defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowserScopedRootTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A browser scoped to one folder acts on what that folder SHOWS.

  A host embeds the browser scoped to a folder of its own — a sub-order's
  "Files" tab, say — and it opens at that folder's root, where
  `current_folder` is `nil` while the heading names the sub-order. A file
  attached to the sub-order is usually a LINK: it lives in the order's own
  folder and the sub-order's folder merely points at it.

  Removing one from that view used to do nothing at all. With no current
  folder the code asked whether the file LIVED in the scope instead of
  whether the scope showed it — false for a link home elsewhere — and the
  handler returned without a flash, an error, or a change. From the outside:
  press Delete, nothing happens.

  The root of a scoped browser IS the scope folder — the move handler has
  always said so — and there a link is removed by taking the link away,
  leaving the file where it lives for every other folder holding it.
