  An admin setting a user's password on `/admin/users/edit/:id` either changes
  it or says why not.

  Reported as: the form said it worked and the user could not sign in with the
  new password. `Auth.admin_update_user_password/3` is not the problem — it
  hashes, writes, revokes the sessions and refuses the new password's
  predecessor. What matters is whether the form reaches it, and what the
  screen says when it does not.
