  Who sets `:url_path` on an admin page.

  The kit's navigation hook does, on every `handle_params`, for every LiveView
  mounted through its on_mount chain. A host filed "every tab-routed page must
  assign `url_path` by hand" — which was false, but understandable: the kit's
  own page GENERATOR emitted `assign(:url_path, "…")` into every page it wrote.
  The hook overwrote it immediately, so the line did nothing except teach the
  wrong pattern from the most trusted place a library has.

  These tests pin both halves: the generated code does not hand-assign it, and
  a page that never assigns it still gets its sidebar entry marked active.
