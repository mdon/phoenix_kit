defmodule PhoenixKit.Test.SecretKeyPerimeter do
  @moduledoc """
  Closes a specific hole in the partition invariant (`settings_test.exs`,
  "every get_defaults/0 key is classified exactly once") — that check only
  walks `Settings.get_defaults/0`, so a secret-shaped setting key core never
  added to `get_defaults/0` at all is invisible to it, not merely
  misclassified. That is exactly how `billing_stripe_secret_key` and its
  siblings went unrestricted: they are written through
  `PhoenixKit.Settings.update_setting/2` by a separate hex package, and no
  `get_defaults/0` entry ever named them, so the invariant had nothing to
  compare them against.

  This module answers a narrower question than "every key core's source
  references must be classified" — that assertion fails today against dozens
  of legitimate module settings never meant to be on either list
  (`entities_max_per_user`, `shop_hide_zero_decimals`, the whole
  `billing_company_*`/`billing_bank_*` invoice-detail group in
  `lib/phoenix_kit/utils/country_data.ex`, ...). Instead: find every key
  literal that LOOKS like it carries live credential material, wherever
  core's own source references or seeds one, so the caller can assert those
  specifically are restricted.

  ## What this can and cannot see

  Scans core's own `lib/` tree and its migration seeds — the two places a
  gap of this exact shape (seeded/referenced, never classified) can actually
  occur inside THIS repository. It structurally CANNOT see a key that only
  exists inside a separate hex package's source (`phoenix_kit_billing`,
  `phoenix_kit_emails`, ...) — those are different git repositories with no
  path into this one. It closes the perimeter for what core owns and can
  read; a module package's own secret-shaped keys are that package's
  responsibility to assert against `PhoenixKit.Settings.restricted_setting_keys/0`
  in its own test suite (it already depends on core, so it can).

  Every setting-key literal passed as the first argument to ANY
  `PhoenixKit.Settings` function anywhere under `root`'s `.ex` files —
  aliased (`Settings.foo("key")`) or fully qualified
  (`PhoenixKit.Settings.foo("key")`), covering `get_setting/1,2`,
  `get_boolean_setting/1,2`, `get_setting_cached/1,2`, `get_json_setting/1,2`,
  `update_setting/2`, `update_boolean_setting/2`, `update_json_setting/2`,
  `update_setting_with_module/3` and anything else with the same shape — not
  a fixed function list, so a new reader/writer added later needs no update
  here. `(?<!\\.)Settings\\.` (rather than a bare `\\bSettings\\.`) so a call
  through some OTHER module also named `Settings` (`Foo.Settings.bar(...)`)
  is not mistaken for this one.

  Also resolves the common `@key_name "literal"` module-attribute pattern
  (`Settings.foo(@key_name)`) back to its literal, in the same file — this is
  how core's own `website_access_password`/`website_access_link_token` are
  actually referenced (`PhoenixKit.WebsiteAccess.Gate`), so without it this
  scan would never see either despite both being real, already-restricted
  keys.

  List-taking readers (`get_settings_direct/1`, `get_settings_cached/2`,
  taking a list of keys rather than one) are not covered — the key isn't a
  single literal argument there, it's a list built from data the scan cannot
  resolve statically.
