defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Components.ViewerSplitOrientationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The popup viewer puts its details panel beside the picture only when the
  popup is wider than it is tall.

  `lg:` alone reads width, and a tall window that happens to be ≥1024px wide
  — a portrait monitor, a half-screen split — kept the side split and squeezed
  a landscape picture into what was left of a column beside a 280-416px panel.
  Measured at 1100×1500 with the panel open: 688×318 of picture before,
  1031×477 after, a little over twice the pixels. `landscape:` adds the shape
  test, so a portrait popup falls back to the stacked layout mobile already
  used — picture on top, panel docked along the bottom, same collapse toggle.

  These assertions read the templates rather than rendering them because the
  rule spans two files that must agree. `MediaCanvasViewer` is the real
  viewer; the `InstantViewer` stand-in in `MediaBrowser` paints a mirror of
  that split on the click, before the server has sent anything back. If the
  stand-in predicts a side split where the viewer will dock at the bottom,
  the hand-off lands with exactly the jump the stand-in exists to prevent —
  and nothing else in the suite would notice, because each half is correct on
  its own.
