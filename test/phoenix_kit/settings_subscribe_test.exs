defmodule PhoenixKit.SettingsSubscribeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `PhoenixKit.Settings.subscribe/0` — live notification of settings changes.

  A host page that changed a setting used to have to invent its own PubSub
  message so other open pages noticed. The kit had an events module with a
  subscribe and a broadcast, and nothing ever called the broadcast.

  What is pinned here is the contract a subscriber relies on:

    * a committed write that changed a value is announced, with the value;
    * a write that changed nothing is announced to nobody;
    * a secret is announced as changed, its value never sent;
    * a delete is announced;
    * when the message arrives, the local cache already holds the new value —
      invalidation used to be a cast, so a subscriber that reacted by reading
      the setting could get the old one back.

  Runs against a REAL settings cache process, since the stale-read race only
  exists when there is a cache to be stale.
