  The language switcher's URL builder.

  Pins the reported break: from `/phoenix_kit/ja/admin`, switching to English
  produced `/phoenix_kit/en/ja/admin` — a path that routes nowhere. The switcher
  offered every *display* language while its URL builder only recognised the
  smaller *enabled* set, so a locale it had just put in the URL was not
  recognised on the way back out.
