defmodule PhoenixKit.Activity.OrderSqlProofTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Guards `Activity.list/1` and `Activity.recent/1` against losing their
  secondary sort key.

  Sorting by `inserted_at` alone is not a total order: the column carries no
  uniqueness constraint, so two entries can tie on it — rows written before
  V185 (`timestamp` went from second to microsecond precision) are all
  whole-second, which is the common case on any existing install, and even
  microsecond-precision writes can land on the identical instant. When they
  do, Postgres is free to break the tie however its query plan happens to
  land — a real, user-visible "recent activity" feed can then show events
  out of the order they actually happened in, and that order can differ
  between two runs of the exact same query. Appending `uuid` (the entry's
  primary key, unique and NOT NULL by schema) as a second sort key closes
  that gap completely: `(inserted_at, uuid)` cannot collide across two
  distinct rows, so the sort has nothing left to arbitrate — no migration,
  no precision upgrade needed.

  This test does not touch a database. It swaps `PhoenixKit.RepoHelper`'s
  configured repo for a stand-in that hands the query straight to
  `PhoenixKit.Test.Repo.to_sql/2` (a pure SQL compile step — no connection is
  opened) and inspects the resulting `ORDER BY` clause. Runs even where
  Postgres is unreachable.
