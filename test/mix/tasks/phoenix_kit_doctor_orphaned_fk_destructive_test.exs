defmodule Mix.Tasks.PhoenixKit.DoctorOrphanedFkDestructiveTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Every test here runs real DDL (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT`,
  `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER CONSTRAINT`) against `phoenix_kit_activities`,
  `phoenix_kit_user_oauth_providers`, and `phoenix_kit_users` — split out of
  `DoctorOrphanedFkTest` for exactly that reason.

  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES` takes a
  `ShareRowExclusiveLock` on BOTH the altered table and the referenced one.
  These tests used to live in `DoctorOrphanedFkTest`, declared
  `async: true` — fine in isolation, but a live full-suite run deadlocked
  (Postgres `40P01`) between two of these DDL statements and one of the
  dozen-plus other async test files that write to `phoenix_kit_users`
  concurrently: this session's ALTER waits on a `ShareRowExclusiveLock`
  held by another async test's row lock, while that test's own next
  write waits on a lock this ALTER already holds — a real deadlock, not
  bad luck, and one the full suite could hit on any run, at random,
  depending on which async tests happened to interleave.

  ExUnit's own scheduling guarantee is the fix: every `async: true` test
  module runs first and concurrently, and every `async: false` module
  runs only after ALL of them have finished, one at a time. Moving the
  actual DDL out of the async module into this one, `async: false`,
  makes the deadlock structurally impossible rather than merely less
  likely — by the time any test here runs, nothing else in the suite is
  still touching `phoenix_kit_users` at all.

    # The widened check reads every single-column FK straight from
    # `pg_constraint` (`discover_fk_constraints/2`), not just the four pairs
    # the old check knew by name. This proves that widened coverage actually
    # catches something the old four-pair list could never have seen:
    # `phoenix_kit_user_oauth_providers.user_uuid -> phoenix_kit_users.uuid`
    # (constraint `fk_user_oauth_providers_user_uuid`) was never one of the
    # old four (`phoenix_kit_users_tokens`, `phoenix_kit_user_role_assignments`,
    # `phoenix_kit_admin_notes`, `phoenix_kit_email_events`).
    #
    # A plain `INSERT` can't produce this row — the constraint rejects a
    # nonexistent `user_uuid` immediately, and it isn't `DEFERRABLE`, so
    # `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED` doesn't buy anything either.
    #
    # Planting the row via `DISABLE TRIGGER ALL` (the original approach)
    # needs superuser: Postgres reserves the internal `RI_ConstraintTrigger`
    # a FK creates for superusers regardless of who owns the table, so it
    # fails outright under the unprivileged-role model `config/test.exs`
    # documents (a role with no `CREATEDB`, pointed at a pre-provisioned
    # database via `PGDATABASE`/`PGPOOL`, owning the tables it migrated).
    #
    # `DROP CONSTRAINT` / re-`ADD ... NOT VALID` (PR #774) also clears that
    # bar, but it plants the orphan behind a constraint that is no longer
    # validated — and `classify_fk_check/6` branches on exactly that. A
    # `{:not_valid, _}` constraint with orphans routes to `:validate`, the
    # clause that predates the widening fix and was never the one at risk.
    # The assertion below could not tell the two apart, so the guard went
    # vacuous for the branch it exists to hold.
    #
    # `ALTER CONSTRAINT ... DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` is the
    # ordinary-DDL route that keeps the constraint VALID: altering an
    # existing FK's deferrability is a plain table-owner operation,
    # `pg_constraint.convalidated` stays `true`, and the deferred RI check
    # fires only at COMMIT — which never comes, because `DataCase` rolls
    # this test's sandbox transaction back. So the orphan is real, and
    # unmatched, for the entire life of the check, sitting behind a
    # constraint Postgres still reports as fully validated: the
    # `:existing_orphan` shape real corruption actually takes.
