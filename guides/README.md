## Guide Purpose

These guides are designed to:
1. **Speed up development** - Provide working examples and patterns
2. **Maintain consistency** - Establish conventions across the codebase
3. **Reduce errors** - Document common pitfalls and solutions
4. **Help AI assistants** - Give clear context for code generation
5. **Onboard new developers** - Comprehensive documentation of systems

## Using These Guides

### For Developers

1. Read the relevant guide before implementing a feature
2. Copy and adapt the patterns to your use case
3. Reference the example files mentioned in each guide
4. Follow the best practices section
5. Check troubleshooting if you encounter issues

### For AI Assistants (Claude, etc.)

These guides provide the context needed to generate accurate code:
- System architecture and locations

- Working examples from the codebase
- Common pitfalls to avoid

When asked to implement a feature, reference the appropriate guide to understand the existing infrastructure and patterns.

## Contributing New Guides

When adding a new guide:

1. **Focus on patterns** - Show how systems work together
2. **Provide examples** - Include working code from the codebase
3. **Reference real files** - Point to actual implementations
4. **Include troubleshooting** - Document common issues
5. **Keep it practical** - Focus on "how to" not just "what is"
