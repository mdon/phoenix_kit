## 1.7.127 - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Standalone notifications — a notification no longer has to come from an
  activity. `PhoenixKit.Notifications.create/1` inserts an
  activity-less notification carrying its own display content:

      Notifications.create(%{
        recipient_uuid: user.uuid,
        text: "Your export is ready.",
        icon: "hero-arrow-down-tray",
        link: "/exports/123"
      })

  `:text` / `:icon` / `:link` fold into a new `metadata` JSONB column as
  the `notification_text` / `notification_icon` / `notification_link`
  keys `Render` already honors; `Render` reads them off the notification
  itself when there's no activity. Honors the `notifications_enabled`
  kill-switch.
- `Notifications.create/1` takes an optional `:type` (notification type
  key) or `:action` (action string) to opt the standalone send into the
  recipient's per-type **preference filter** (fail-open) — omit both for
  an unconditional app-driven send.
- `Notifications.create_many/2` — the multi-recipient fan-out primitive:
  one standalone notification per recipient uuid (caller supplies the
  list, e.g. an author's followers), de-duped, each filtered
  independently by `:type`/`:action` prefs. Returns `{:ok, created_count}`.
- `Notifications.Prefs.user_wants_type?/2` — type-keyed preference check
  (vs the action-keyed `user_wants?/2`), backing the `:type` filter above.
- Notifications is now a toggleable core **module** (`use PhoenixKit.Module`):
  it appears as a card on the admin Modules page (enable/disable flips the
  existing `notifications_enabled` kill-switch) and contributes a
  `/admin/notifications` overview page + admin nav tab. The overview is a
  simple read-only page — enabled state, retention window, and aggregate
  counts (total / unread / dismissed via `Notifications.admin_stats/0`).

### Migrations
- **V126** — `phoenix_kit_notifications.activity_uuid` is now nullable
  (standalone notifications) and a `metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`
  column is added. The `(activity_uuid, recipient_uuid)` unique index
  still holds (Postgres treats NULLs as distinct). `@current_version` → 126.

## 1.7.126 - 2026-05-30

### Added
- `MediaBrowser.Embed` gains an opt-in `url_sync` option so any embedding
  LiveView gets shareable, deep-linkable folder URLs with one line:

      use PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.Embed, url_sync: true
      # or, for a non-default component id / multiple browsers:
      use PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.Embed, url_sync: [id: "my-browser"]

  It provides the full controlled-mode round-trip the host previously had
  to hand-write (~50 lines), via LiveView lifecycle hooks attached in
  `on_mount` (not injected `handle_params`/`handle_info` clauses) so it
  **composes with a host that already defines its own** — e.g. an
  `…/orders/:id/edit/files` page that loads the order in its own
  `handle_params`. `on_mount` parses `:initial_params` from the URL, a
  `:handle_params` hook feeds them to the component, and a `:handle_info`
  hook intercepts the component's `{:navigate, …}` and `push_patch`es
  folder / search / page / view onto the current path (every existing
  segment — locale, parent ids, sub-tab — preserved). Folder is tracked
  by uuid (stable across renames; unknown/out-of-scope falls back to
  root); base path is taken from the live URL so router prefixes are
  respected. Reusable `parse_nav_params/1` + `build_nav_query/1` helpers
  are public. The host template passes `on_navigate={:navigate}` +
  `initial_params={@initial_params}`. A `push_patch` issued from a
  `handle_info` hook makes LiveView call `view.handle_params/3`
  unconditionally, so the macro injects a trivial `handle_params/3` stub
  when (and only when) the host defines none — a host with its own keeps
  it. (Note: changing the macro requires recompiling the host;
  `mix deps.compile phoenix_kit --force` in a parent app after updating.)
  The `:handle_params` hook only re-syncs the component when the parsed
  folder / search / page / view actually changed, so unrelated host
  navigation on a multi-purpose page doesn't trigger a needless reload.
- Installer: the `catalogue_pdf` Oban queue (concurrency 2) is now added
  to the host Oban config on `mix phoenix_kit.install` /
  `mix phoenix_kit.update` (and to the fresh-install default queues).
  `phoenix_kit_catalogue` enqueues a `:catalogue_pdf` job per uploaded PDF
  (`pdfinfo` + `pdftotext` text extraction); Oban only runs listed queues,
  so without this entry the jobs sat `available` forever — uploads looked
  fine but text search silently never worked. Added unconditionally (an
  idle queue costs nothing) so a host that later adds the catalogue module
  is already wired.

### Changed
- `/admin/media` (`Live.Users.Media`) now uses `url_sync` instead of its
  bespoke `handle_params`/`handle_info`/`initial_params` plumbing —
  behavior unchanged, ~45 lines lighter.
- MediaBrowser Move modal: the destination picker is now a collapsible
  directory tree (chevron expand/collapse + colored folder icons),
  matching the left-sidebar experience, instead of a flat fully-expanded
  dump of every folder in the project. It **opens seeded from the
  sidebar's current expansion** (`expanded_folders`), so the picker shows
  the same open directories you already see on the left, then tracks its
  own `move_expanded` independently (drilling in the picker doesn't move
  the sidebar). The picker is a plain full-width `<ul>` (not a daisyUI
  `menu`, which laid the custom tree rows out horizontally and spilled
  past the box); names truncate and horizontal overflow is clipped so it
  fits the modal.

### Fixed
- MediaBrowser: the grid/list view toggle and the item count no longer
  vanish in an empty folder (or a folder that has subfolders but no
  files). They were gated on `@total_count > 0` (file count only); now
  shown whenever there are files, folders, or you're inside a folder.
- `<.pagination_info>` renders "No results" at `total_count == 0` instead
  of the nonsensical "Showing 1 to 0 results".
- MediaBrowser: the bulk **Move** button is disabled in Select Mode until
  at least one item is selected (matching the Download/Delete actions,
  which already hide with an empty selection). The `show_move_modal`
  handler is guarded too, so it can't open an empty modal.

### Migrations
- **V125** — project workflow statuses (entities-backed, cement-at-start).
  New `phoenix_kit_project_statuses` table (the cemented per-project status
  snapshot: `project_uuid` FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`, `label` / `slug` /
  `position`, `data` + `translations` JSONB, `source_entity_data_uuid`
  provenance with no FK; index on `(project_uuid)`, unique on
  `(project_uuid, slug)`). New columns on `phoenix_kit_projects`:
  `status_entity_uuid` (FK → `phoenix_kit_entities` `ON DELETE SET NULL`),
  `current_status_slug`, a generic `settings` JSONB, and a free-form
  `external_id VARCHAR(255)` for tying a project to an external system
  (not unique, not an FK; partial-indexed `WHERE NOT NULL`, set
  programmatically). Idempotent; `down/0` reverses to 124.
  `@current_version` is now 125.

## 1.7.125 - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- `<.load_more infinite>` no longer over-fetches or wedges. The
  `InfiniteScroll` JS hook now re-fires only when its `data-cursor`
  changes (not on every unrelated LiveView diff), guards against stacked
  in-flight pushes, and carries a 2s watchdog so a load that resolves
  without advancing the cursor (empty/no-op page, stale `total`, or a
  replace-in-place list with a constant `loaded`) can never permanently
  disable auto-scroll — worst case is a brief stall that the next scroll
  or the manual button recovers.
- `MediaBrowser.Embed`'s injected `:leaf_changed` forwarder no longer
  crashes the host LiveView if `PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent.forward_leaf_event/2`
  returns an unexpected value — an `other ->` branch logs a warning and
  degrades to `{:noreply, socket}`.
- Inline annotation-title edits from the comments sidebar now log a
  `Logger.warning` when the underlying `Annotations.update/2` write fails
  (previously the error was discarded, making a failed write
  indistinguishable from a no-op). UX is unchanged — still no flash.

### Changed
- `<.load_more>`: in `infinite` mode, `data-cursor` defaults to `@loaded`
  (so most callers can omit `cursor`), and the component raises a clear
  `ArgumentError` when `infinite` is set without an `id`. `resolve_cursor/1`
  is now nil/type-safe and computed only for the infinite variant.
- Bump the lazy-load `etcher` CDN pin in `phoenix_kit.js` `v0.5.2 → v0.5.3`
  to match the resolved `etcher` hex dependency.


### Merged
- Merged upstream `dev`, which added **V122** (`phoenix_kit_location_spaces`
  + staff `translations` JSONB + staff `Person.name`) and **V123**
  (catalogue folders: `phoenix_kit_cat_folders` + `cat_catalogues.folder_uuid`),
  plus the `<.load_more>` infinite-scroll option.

### Migrations
- **V124** — the media-folder partial unique index (previously authored
  as V122 on this fork) is **renumbered to V124** because upstream
  claimed V122/V123. Content is unchanged: restricts
  `phoenix_kit_media_folders_name_parent_idx` to `WHERE trashed_at IS NULL`.
  `@current_version` is now 124.

## 1.7.123 - 2026-05-29

### Added
- `/admin/media/:file_uuid` (MediaDetail) now renders the image through
  the Fresco canvas + Etcher annotation layer instead of a plain
  `<img>`, reaching parity with the in-place modal: draw / edit / delete
  annotations, the composer popover, and persistence all work on the
  standalone page. Implemented via a new `viewer_only` mode on
  `MediaCanvasViewer` that suppresses its close button + sidebar so a
  page host can supply its own chrome.
- A comments thread (annotation-aware) on MediaDetail, above the Storage
  Locations card — mirrors the modal sidebar's embed. Promotes
  `MediaCanvasViewer.load_annotations_for/1`,
  `build_comment_decorations/1`, and `comments_enabled?/0` to public so
  page hosts reuse them.

### Changed
- Bump leaf 0.2.20 → 0.2.21 (hex dep + `phoenix_kit.js` CDN pin).

### Fixed
- MediaDetail's embedded canvas now receives the file's intrinsic
  `width` / `height`, so the Fresco canvas matches the source image
  aspect instead of falling back to a 1000×1000 square (which letterboxed
  the image and stranded annotations on the dotted background).

## 1.7.122 - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- `pagination_info` drops the redundant `of N` suffix when the result set
  fits on one page (`total_count <= per_page`) — e.g. "Showing 1 to 4
  results" instead of "Showing 1 to 4 of 4 results". The media browser
  toolbar reads cleaner; multi-page views are unchanged.
- New folder creation at the root of a scoped media browser no longer fails
  silently when a trashed "untitled" folder still occupies the unique
  index slot. V124 restricts `phoenix_kit_media_folders_name_parent_idx`
  to `WHERE trashed_at IS NULL`, so trashed folders no longer reserve
  names from the user's perspective.
- `MediaBrowser.Embed` now forwards `{:leaf_changed, _}` events from
  sidebar comment Leaf editors to `PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent`
  via runtime `Code.ensure_loaded?` + `apply/3` (sibling deps with no
  compile-order guarantee). Without this, typed content in those editors
  never reached the server. User-defined `:leaf_changed` clauses still win
  because the injected clause is appended last.

### Changed
- The inline rename input for the auto-created "untitled" folder now
  selects all of its value on mount instead of just focusing — type
  immediately replaces the placeholder name without reaching for the
  mouse. Implemented via a new tiny `SelectOnMount` JS hook in
  `phoenix_kit.js` (reusable for any "type-to-replace" inline edit).

### Migrations
- **V124** — `phoenix_kit_media_folders_name_parent_idx` is now a partial
  unique index `WHERE trashed_at IS NULL`. Active siblings are the only
  rows the constraint sees, matching what `Storage.list_folders/2`
  returns. (Renumbered from V122 after the upstream merge — see 1.7.124.)

## 1.7.121 - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Core list-UI toolkit for admin tables, all in
  `lib/phoenix_kit_web/components/core/` (PR #568):
  - `BulkSelect` — `<.bulk_select_scope>` + `<.bulk_select_header_cell>` +
    `<.bulk_select_cell>` + `<.bulk_actions_toolbar>`. Selection lives
    client-side via the `BulkSelectScope` JS hook (per-checkbox toggles feel
    instant — no LV round-trip); the server only receives the selected uuids
    at action time as `%{"uuids" => [...]}`. The selection survives LV
    re-renders (reorder / load_more / sort).
  - `Sortable` — `<.sortable_tbody>` + `<.sortable_row>` wrap the
    `SortableGrid` hook wiring; `enabled={false}` cleanly omits the hook so
    drag turns off when sorting by a non-position field. Pair with
    `<.drag_handle_cell>` / `<.drag_handle_header_cell>` on `<.table_default>`.
  - `<.reorder_modal>` — strategy-picker dialog for bulk reorder; the consumer
    LV owns the strategy whitelist.
  - `<.load_more>` pagination footer (in `core/pagination.ex`) for embeddable /
    DnD-aware lists where rows append rather than navigate away.
- `<.modal keep_in_dom>` mode — renders the `<dialog>` regardless of `@show`
  and flips visibility via `data-show` + the `PkDialog` hook, enabling instant
  client-side open without a server round-trip (PR #568).
- `PhoenixKit.boot/1` hook so late-loaded modules can register after app start
  (PR #569).

### Changed
- `<.modal>` now renders a native `<dialog>` in the browser top layer
  (`PkDialog` hook + `showModal()`) instead of `<div class="modal">`. It is
  immune to ancestor stacking contexts / z-index and covers the full visual
  viewport (PR #568).
- `<.sort_selector>` is now race-free: the field select sends only `sort_by`
  and the direction arrow sends only `sort_dir`; the LV handler derives the
  missing half from assigns. Manual-order mode hides the direction toggle
  entirely (PR #568).
- `<.table_default>` rows carry a named `group/row` Tailwind marker (not a bare
  `group`) so the drag-handle hide-until-hover reveal stays keyed to row hover
  without clobbering unnamed `group-hover:` utilities nested in cells (PR #568).
- Activity feed renders dates with locale-aware formatting (PR #569).
- `redirect_invalid_locale/2` reads `prefixless_primary?()` once instead of
  twice, removing a torn-read window on a concurrent setting flip
  (PR #554 follow-up).
- Annotation storage adapter no longer accepts `:creator_uuid` from event
  payloads — authorship is resolved server-side from the actor, so a forged
  payload can't claim it (PR #550 follow-up).

### Fixed
- PkDialog top-layer leak: a `<dialog>` opened via `showModal()` stayed in the
  top layer (still capturing all clicks) after Phoenix LV's DOM patcher
  stripped the browser-added `open` attribute on re-render, while CSS rendered
  it `display: none` — visually closed but blocking the rest of the page.
  `PkDialog` now uses the `:modal` pseudo-class as the truth source and
  restores the stripped attribute before `close()` (PR #568).
- The "Reorder N selected" bulk-toolbar label was rendered untranslated: it
  used `gettext_noop/1` (extraction-only) and the JS hook does no translation,
  so it stayed English in every non-default locale. Now translated at render
  time while preserving the `%{count}` placeholder for client-side interpolation
  (PR #568 post-merge review).
- `<.drag_handle_cell>`'s default title now renders (the `default: nil` attr was
  shadowing `assign_new`) (PR #568).
- Registration and magic-link registration fieldsets unified to
  `class="fieldset min-w-0"` (dropped redundant `w-full`) (PR #559 follow-up).
- Combined the split revoke-all-sessions confirmation sentence into one
  translatable string (PR #569).
- Guard `stat.label` against non-binary values in the modules overview
  (PR #569).

### i18n
- Broad i18n coverage sweep across the user-facing admin pages — Users
  management, Session management, Live Sessions, User Settings, the General
  settings sidebar tab, and the Modules overview — with ru/et catalogs brought
  back to 100% and fuzzy msgids / mistranslations corrected (PR #569).
- Translate the stranded "Last updated:" label in Live Sessions (PR #569).

## 1.7.120 - 2026-05-24

### Changed
- Ecommerce admin i18n is now owned by the `phoenix_kit_ecommerce` module
  instead of PhoenixKit core. The `PhoenixKitWeb.EcommerceGettextManifest` shim
  that re-emitted ecommerce strings into core's POT for extraction is gone, and
  ~1,750 ecommerce-only msgids are dropped from `default.pot` and every locale
  catalog — ecommerce translations now live in the module's own gettext (PR #567).
- Dependency bump: `etcher` 0.4.9 → 0.4.10.

### Removed
- `PhoenixKitWeb.EcommerceGettextManifest` — ecommerce translation extraction
  moved into the `phoenix_kit_ecommerce` module (PR #567).

### Fixed
- Mobile horizontal overflow on card surfaces. `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.ModuleCard`
  and the `TableDefault` card views are now shrink-safe — `min-w-0` + `break-words`
  on the flex/grid children keep a long unbreakable token (email, username) from
  forcing a card wider than its grid track — and the module admin-links row wraps
  via `flex-wrap` instead of overflowing (PR #567).

### i18n
- Completed `ru` / `et` translations for newly-extracted core strings
  (sort-selector direction tooltips, "URL Behavior" language settings, annotation
  toolbar hint), restoring both locales to 100%.
- Fixed fuzzy msgids and `ru` / `et` mistranslations swept in by the ecommerce
  i18n extract (PR #567).

## 1.7.119 - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.TableDefault` — `:class` attr widened from
  `:string` to `:any` on all 7 `table_default*` components, so the
  Phoenix-idiomatic `class={[if(...), ...]}` list form compiles without an attr
  warning. The components already wrap `@class` in a flattened list, so there is
  no rendered-output change for existing string callers (PR #565).
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MultilangForm` — the standalone info alert is now a
  hover/focus tooltip on an info icon beside the "Content Language" header, and
  the default loading skeleton uses `bg-base-content/15 animate-pulse` instead of
  daisyUI's near-invisible `.skeleton`, so the loading state is visible on
  `bg-base-100` cards (PR #565).
- `Translation.handle_ai_response/2` extracts the OpenAI-shaped completion
  content inline rather than via `PhoenixKitAI.Completion.extract_content/1`,
  dropping the cross-module dependency on the optional AI plugin — works whether
  the plugin is present, absent, or stubbed (PR #565).
- Dependency bumps: `etcher` 0.4.8 → 0.4.9, `fresco` 0.5.5 → 0.5.8,
  `floki` 0.38.2 → 0.38.3.

### Fixed
- AI translation parser no longer leaks an unrequested marker's content into the
  preceding field. A field capture now terminates at any line-anchored
  `\n---<NAME>---` marker, not just the requested-field markers — so a model
  emitting an extra `---TITLE---` (e.g. from an unbound `{{title}}` template
  variable) no longer rolls that block into the prior `---NAME---` field. The
  newline anchor keeps literal mid-paragraph `---WORD---` tokens (technical docs,
  API examples) inside the capture (PR #565).
- AI translation empty sections resolve consistently to `""`. A present-but-empty
  trailing marker now records `""` instead of failing the whole response with
  `{:parse_error, {:missing_fields, ...}}`, matching how an empty middle section
  already resolved. A genuinely absent marker still reports `missing_fields`, so
  the "model forgot a marker" signal is preserved (follow-up to PR #565).

## 1.7.118 - 2026-05-21

### Added
- `card_grid_class` attr on `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.TableDefault` —
  overrides the card-view grid layout (column density, gaps) without touching
  the component. Default unchanged. Must be layout-only (no `display` utility —
  the component sets `grid`/`hidden` per view-mode branch) and a literal in a
  Tailwind-scanned source so the classes compile (PR #561).
- Responsive `cols` on `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.DraggableList` (and the
  `MediaGallery` passthrough) — `:cols` now accepts a string of Tailwind
  grid-column classes (e.g. `"grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-6 2xl:grid-cols-8"`) for a
  responsive thumbnail grid, in addition to an integer 1..6. Any other value
  (out-of-range integer, atom, …) falls back to `grid-cols-4` (PR #561).

### Changed
- `MediaGallery` now hides the Add tile entirely once the selection reaches
  `max_count` (or 1 in `:single` mode), instead of rendering it disabled and
  greyed. Supersedes the disable-at-limit behavior shipped in 1.7.117 (PR #561).
- Magic-link registration request sends the email via `start_async`, so the
  submit is non-blocking and the in-flight spinner renders, matching the
  password-less magic-link login flow. Replaces the prior `phx-disable-with`
  (follow-up to PR #559).
- Dependency bumps: `etcher` 0.4.6 → 0.4.8, `fresco` 0.5.4 → 0.5.5,
  `ex_doc` 0.40.2 → 0.40.3.

### Fixed
- AI translation no longer fails on every real request.
  `Translation.translate_fields/6` was treating `PhoenixKitAI.ask_with_prompt/4`'s
  OpenAI-shaped response map (`%{"choices" => [...]}`) as `:unexpected_response`
  and erroring out. The success branch now routes map responses through
  `PhoenixKitAI.Completion.extract_content/1` (the helper publishing's
  `TranslatePostWorker` already uses), with a raw-binary fallback so test stubs
  and older plugin versions keep working (PR #560).
- `Translation.translate_fields/6` rejects an empty `fields` map up front with
  `{:error, {:parse_error, :no_markers}}` instead of rendering a field-less
  prompt and spending an AI request that only fails downstream in the parser
  (PR #558).
- Auth-form submit buttons no longer overflow their card.
  `<fieldset>`'s browser-default `min-width: min-content` let the fieldset — and
  its `w-full` submit button — grow past the form width; `min-w-0` is now applied
  to the six remaining auth-form fieldsets. Also dropped `phx-disable-with` on
  the magic-link login form, where it collided with the `@loading` branch and
  made LiveView's diff merger inject a stray SVG into the button (PR #559).

## 1.7.117 - 2026-05-21

### Added
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.AI` — core-side conveniences for the optional
  `PhoenixKitAI` plugin. `available?/0` is a module-loadability check (loaded
  AND exports `ask_with_prompt/4`); gate AI-driven UI on it so apps without the
  plugin fall back to non-AI behavior automatically (PR #557).
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.AI.Translation` — shared AI-translation orchestration
  reused by every feature module that wants AI translation. `translate_fields/6`
  takes a `%{field_name => text}` map and returns the same shape, or a
  normalized `{:error, atom_or_tuple}` covering every failure mode (missing
  endpoint/prompt, plugin absent, duplicate/partial markers, AI exception/exit).
  `parse_response/2` is the public, case-insensitive `---FIELD_NAME---` parser.
  Each dispatch writes one `core.ai_translation.requested` activity entry for a
  unified token-spend audit trail (PR #557).
- `ai_translate` attr on `LanguageSwitcher.language_switcher_dropdown` — opt-in
  affordance that renders a per-missing-language sparkle button plus a bulk
  "translate all missing" CTA. The component is pure event-emit (no
  `PhoenixKitAI` reference): it fires the host's `phx-click` event and the host
  enqueues its own translation worker. `nil`/`enabled: false` = today's behavior
  (PR #557).
- `max_count` attr on `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaGallery` — caps the number
  of selected images in `:multiple` mode and disables the Add button at the
  limit (defence-in-depth: `apply_selection` also clamps). `nil` = unlimited;
  `:single` mode implies a limit of 1 (PR #556).
- `card_media` slot on `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.TableDefault` — optional
  media region (thumbnail / cover image / document preview) rendered above the
  card body in card view; the slot owns its own padding/background (PR #556).
- Controlled `view_mode` (+ `view_event`) on `TableDefault` — pass
  `view_mode="card"|"table"` to take the card⇄table toggle from assigns instead
  of the default JS hook + localStorage. The component then renders only that
  view and the toolbar buttons emit `view_event` with `phx-value-mode`, so the
  view choice can be URL-backed (`push_patch`) or survive LV navigation (PR #556).
- `class` attr on `TableDefault.table_default_header` — override the header
  styling per call site (PR #556).

### Changed
- `TableDefault.table_default_header` default changed from
  `bg-primary text-primary-content` to `bg-base-300` — a calmer, theme-neutral
  header that reads as a subtle separator from `<tbody>`. This affects every
  `<.table_default_header>` that does not pass an explicit `class`. Pass
  `class="bg-primary text-primary-content"` to restore the previous look, or
  `class=""` for a bare header (PR #556).
- `MediaGallery` in `:single` mode now disables the Add button once an image is
  selected; replace the image via the per-thumbnail Remove (✕) then Add. The
  selection cap of 1 is unchanged (PR #556).

## 1.7.116 - 2026-05-20

### Added
- `Languages.prefixless_primary_safe?/0` — boot- and mix-task-safe wrapper
  around `default_language_no_prefix?/0`. Returns `false` during mix-task
  context (via the same `:phoenix_kit_config_status` sentinel `Routes.path/1`
  uses) and rescues any other lookup exception to `false`. Use from
  boot/middleware contexts where the Settings table may not be reachable;
  `default_language_no_prefix?/0` remains the runtime entry point.
  `Routes.path/1` and `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth` now both delegate to this
  canonical implementation (PR #554).
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Sitemap.LocalePath` — shared `emit_prefix?/2`
  decision rule for the three sitemap sources (`publishing`, `static`,
  `posts`). Each source still owns its segment formatting (display code
  with hreflang awareness for publishing, base code for static + posts);
  the module owns only the decision so the policy stays consistent across
  sources (PR #554).
- `DialectMapper.group_dialects_by_base/1` — counts sibling dialects per
  base language code. Used by the language switcher and admin/user nav
  dropdowns to decide whether to show a country qualifier (PR #555).
- `LanguageSwitcher.dedupe_names/1` + `extract_base_language_name/1` —
  public helpers called from `AdminNav` and `UserDashboardNav` so all
  language menus share one country-qualifier dedup rule (PR #555).

### Changed
- Frontend language switcher (`PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.LanguageSwitcher`'s
  dropdown + continent-grouped views) now drops the country qualifier from
  rendered labels when only one dialect of a given base language is enabled.
  `English (United States)`, `Estonian (Estonia)`, `French (France)` render
  as `English`, `Estonian`, `French` whenever no sibling dialect is
  configured; enabling a second dialect of the same base (e.g. `en-US` +
  `en-GB`) causes those entries to reacquire the country qualifier so they
  remain distinguishable. Same rule applies in the admin top-bar dropdown
  and user dashboard nav. Continent-grouped views compute sibling counts
  globally across all enabled languages, so a base split across continents
  keeps its qualifier in both groups. Restores the bare-label rendering
  that was lost when commit `d1c2d577` rewrote the switcher to
  one-row-per-dialect (PR #555).
- Sitemap sources `publishing`, `static`, and `posts` share one
  `LocalePath.emit_prefix?/2` decision rule instead of three byte-identical
  copies; three near-identical private `single_language_mode?/0` helpers
  collapse into one defensive lookup on `LocalePath` (PR #554).
- `redirect_invalid_locale/2` honors the site-wide
  `default_language_no_prefix` setting. With the setting OFF (default), an
  invalid locale segment is swapped for the primary base code so the
  redirect lands on the canonical prefixed shape; with the setting ON, the
  segment is stripped entirely. Previously the plug always emitted the
  prefixless shape, which was inconsistent with how the rest of the app
  emits primary-language URLs when the setting is OFF (PR #554).
- Dependency bumps: `etcher` 0.3.0 → 0.4.0, `fresco` 0.5.2 → 0.5.3.

### Fixed
- Login (and any other primary-language POST) no longer fails with the
  default `default_language_no_prefix` setting. `process_valid_locale/2`
  was unconditionally 301-redirecting `/<default>/...` → `/...` for
  non-admin requests, discarding the POST body. The redirect is now gated
  on `Languages.prefixless_primary_safe?/0` so the canonical primary shape
  matches whichever setting state the site is in (PR #554).
- Sitemap sources `static.ex` and `posts.ex` honor the site-wide
  `default_language_no_prefix` setting for the primary language. Both had
  the same `_is_default` ignored bug that PR #552 fixed in the publishing
  source — they previously emitted `/en/about` and `/en/blog/post` in
  multilang mode regardless of the setting (PR #554).

## 1.7.115 - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Site-wide `default_language_no_prefix` setting on the Languages admin page
  (`/admin/settings/languages`) controls whether the primary language emits
  its locale segment in URLs. When on, `/admin/users` and `/blog/post`
  replace `/en/admin/users` and `/en/blog/post` across admin pages, public
  pages, sitemap, and redirects; other languages always keep their prefix.
  Default is off, matching the historical publishing default, so existing
  installs' indexed URLs stay stable on upgrade. Installs that previously
  toggled `publishing_default_language_no_prefix` get auto-migrated to the
  new key on the next boot via `Languages.migrate_legacy/0` (PR #552).
- `@type t/0` on `PhoenixKit.Settings.Setting` schema. Lets consumers spec
  setting-returning functions (`{:ok, Settings.Setting.t()} | {:error, …}`)
  without tripping dialyzer's `unknown_type` warning.

### Changed
- Admin URL emission for the primary language now follows the new site-wide
  `default_language_no_prefix` setting (default off), restoring the
  `/en/admin/users` shape that 1.7.114 had emitted prefixless
  unconditionally. Both URL shapes still resolve at the router level via the
  dual-scope admin emission, so existing bookmarks and external links keep
  working (PR #552).
- Dependency bumps: `ecto` 3.13.6 → 3.14.0, `ecto_sql` 3.13.5 → 3.14.0,
  `fresco` 0.5.0 → 0.5.2, `hammer` 7.3.0 → 7.4.0.

### Fixed
- Publishing sitemap honors `default_language_no_prefix` for the primary
  language. Previously the sitemap always emitted `/en/blog/post` in
  multilang mode regardless of the setting, drifting away from the URLs
  publishing actually served at request time (PR #552).
- `Languages.default_language_no_prefix?/0` docstring no longer references
  the nonexistent `PhoenixKit.Migration.migrate_default_language_no_prefix/0`
  — points at the real entry point `migrate_legacy/0`.
- `Routes.admin_path/2` `## Examples` no longer mixes setting-dependent
  cases with deterministic ones inside `iex>` doctest prompts, so adding
  `doctest PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes` later won't fail. Setting-dependent
  shapes are still shown, just outside the executable doctest block.

## 1.7.114 - 2026-05-19

### Added
- `module_assigns` attribute on `LayoutWrapper.app_layout` — a single map
  whose keys are merged into the assigns passed to a host's parent layout,
  letting feature modules thread arbitrary host-consumable data (e.g.
  `phoenix_kit_publishing_translations`) across the layout boundary without
  core having to declare each key (PR #551).

### Changed
- Locale resolution is now URL-authoritative. The `phoenix_kit_locale_base`
  session value and `user.custom_fields["preferred_locale"]` are no longer
  read for routing — the URL's locale segment (or its absence) is the only
  source of truth across both the LiveView mount and the HTTP plug. Fixes a
  sticky-locale bug where visiting one locale-prefixed URL pinned that locale
  onto every later prefixless URL (PR #551).
- Admin URLs drop the locale segment for the primary language, matching
  non-admin behaviour. Both `/<prefix>/admin/*` and
  `/<prefix>/:locale/admin/*` remain routable, so legacy prefixed links keep
  working (PR #551).
- Admin, public, and authenticated-dashboard LiveView routes are each served
  from a single unified `live_session` (`:phoenix_kit_admin`,
  `:phoenix_kit_public`, `:phoenix_kit_authenticated`) spanning both the
  primary-language (`/<prefix>/...`) and locale-prefixed
  (`/<prefix>/:locale/...`) URL shapes. Switching locale now stays on the
  WebSocket via `push_navigate` instead of forcing a full-page reload —
  previously each surface was split across two sessions and every locale
  change crossed a `live_session` boundary.
- `DialectMapper.resolve_dialect/2` collapsed to `resolve_dialect/1`: dialect
  resolution is URL-driven and no longer consults a user's
  `custom_fields["preferred_locale"]`. Removed the now-unused
  `User.preferred_locale_changeset/2` and `User.get_preferred_locale/1`.

### Fixed
- Table RowMenu dropdown is portaled to `<body>` while open so its
  `position: fixed` coordinates escape any `<dialog>` or `transform`/`contain`
  containing block — previously the menu could render far off-screen inside
  modals (PR #551). It also no longer leaves a duplicate menu element behind
  when a server-side LiveView update re-renders the row while the menu is
  open.
- Publishing route dispatch threads the workspace `url_prefix`, so it keeps
  working when PhoenixKit is mounted under a non-root path (PR #551).

## 1.7.113 - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `line` annotation kind — a two-endpoint line tool alongside `dimension`
  (same geometry, no arrowheads, no inline numeric label). V121 migration
  widens the `phoenix_kit_annotations_kind_check` constraint to accept it.
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaCanvasViewer` — shared LiveComponent owning
  the per-file canvas + Etcher annotation layer + composer popover + comments
  thread. Embedded by both `MediaBrowser` and `MediaViewer`, so files opened
  via `MediaGallery` → `MediaViewer` get the full pan/zoom + annotation
  experience (PR #550).
- `Storage.folder_subtree_uuids/1` is now public — walks a folder tree and
  returns every descendant uuid including the root (PR #549).

### Changed
- `MediaBrowser` migrated to Etcher 0.3 + Fresco 0.5: per-op annotation events
  collapse into a single bulk `etcher:annotations-changed` diff; `fresco` and
  `etcher` deps flipped from local path deps to hex pins (`~> 0.5` / `~> 0.3`)
  (PR #550).
- Annotation composer now positions itself above its shape and drops the
  shape entirely when dismissed via Cancel (PR #550).
- Deleting an annotation now hard-deletes its linked comments instead of
  leaving `[removed]` placeholders in the file's thread (PR #550).
- Activity and Users/Sessions filter panels relocated into the
  `<.table_default>` toolbar row; tables render unconditionally with the
  empty state as a table-body row so filters/search stay visible on a
  zero-result filter (PR #549).

### Fixed
- Users/Sessions search regression — form-less `<input>`s no longer delivered
  `phx-change`; search inputs are wrapped in `<form phx-change="search">`
  again (PR #549).
- Folder-scoped media picker now includes images in nested subfolders, not
  just files directly in the scope folder (PR #549).
- V120 migration tolerates a missing `phoenix_kit_doc_template_presets` table
  on hosts that never installed the Document Creator module — the index
  rebuild is guarded on table existence (PR #550).
- V121 migration adds the kind-check constraint unconditionally after
  `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS`; the previous `pg_constraint` existence guard
  was not schema-scoped and would skip the add on multi-prefix installs.
- Annotation updates no longer cast `:uuid`, closing a path where a stray
  payload uuid could rewrite an annotation's primary key.
- `MediaCanvasViewer` annotation sync skips no-op `UPDATE`s — Etcher
  re-broadcasts the full annotation list on every mutation, so untouched
  rows are now diffed out and a zero-net-change re-broadcast does no DB work.
- Users role-filter dropdown reflects the active filter again (`<option
  selected>` instead of an ignored `<select value>`); the empty-state
  "Clear Filters" button resets all filters via a dedicated handler.
- Activity empty state distinguishes "No activities match the current
  filters" from "No activities recorded yet".

## 1.7.112 - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaGallery` — reusable LiveComponent for selecting,
  ordering, previewing and removing a set of images.
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaViewer` — standalone image lightbox LiveComponent
  (prev/next, keyboard, download). Extracted from `MediaGallery`; usable independently.
- `Storage.get_files/1` — batch file fetch preserving input order.
- `FolderExplorer` component — folder tree extracted from `MediaBrowser` as a
  reusable component (PR #544).
- `<.table_default>` sort + drag-to-reorder primitives (PR #548)
  - New `:sort_bar` slot rendered above the toolbar, visible in both card and table views.
  - `<.table_default_body>` accepts `:global` attrs so consumers can wire the
    `SortableGrid` hook (`phx-hook`, `data-sortable-*`) directly onto `<tbody>`.
  - `<.table_default_header_cell>` `:inner_block` is now optional — empty `<th>`
    cells for drag-handle / selection columns no longer need a placeholder.
  - `:card_body` slot for fully-custom card content; `:card_class` accepts a string
    or `(item) -> string` function; `:above_cards` slot; `2xl:grid-cols-4` card grid.
- `<.sort_selector>` core component — field-picker select + direction toggle, with a
  `manual_field` mode that swaps the toggle for a drag-handle hint (PR #548).
- `<.bulk_actions_bar>` core component — selection counter + action-button slot +
  Clear button; `wrapper_class` covers the inline-card and sticky/blurred shapes (PR #548).
- `<.empty_state>` core component — `compact` / `card` / `featured` "no rows" panels
  with optional icon, description, and CTA slot (PR #548).
- `<.form_section>` and `<.form_actions>` core components — card-wrapped titled form
  sections and a Cancel + Submit footer bar (PR #548).
- New `PhoenixKit.Utils` helpers (PR #548)
  - `Reorder.reorder/4` — two-phase index-rewrite primitive for drag-to-reorder list
    views; schema-agnostic, UUID-filtered, payload-capped, returns `{:ok, count}`.
  - `Values.blank_to_nil/1` and `Values.presence/1` — canonical `"" → nil` helpers
    (the latter trims first); previously duplicated across 7+ modules.
  - `Format.bytes/2` — single human-readable byte formatter with `:decimals` /
    `:unknown` / `:base` (1024 vs 1000) options; replaced 8 private copies.
- V120 migration — document-creator category / type taxonomy (PR #545).

### Changed
- `MediaSelectorModal` accepts an optional `notify: {module, id}` to deliver the
  selection via `send_update` instead of a process message.
- `MediaGallery` delegates its inline lightbox to `MediaViewer` — no behavior
  change for existing consumers.
- `<.draggable_list>` gains an optional `target` attr (CSS selector). When set,
  the `SortableGrid` hook routes the reorder event via `pushEventTo` so it
  reaches a LiveComponent rather than the host LiveView.
- `<.sort_header_cell>` polish — inactive-column up/down hint, in-flight loading
  spinner, and atom-or-string `sort.dir` tolerance (PR #548).
- `admin_page_header` — `back` / `back_click` are now deprecated no-ops; the back
  arrow no longer renders. Retained so existing call sites compile (PR #548).
- `MediaBrowser` folder management overhaul (PR #544)
  - Recursive folder trash + drag-to-trash; instant "untitled" folder creation.
  - Folders draggable across grid / list / sidebar; drop-into-current-folder via
    the main content area; whole-selection drag in select mode.
  - Per-file and per-folder kebab menus migrated to `TableRowMenu` (fixes clipping).
  - Folder rename made more apparent; click-away cancels.
- etcher / fresco dependency requirements tightened to `~> 0.2.6`.
- Upgraded library dependencies.

### Fixed
- `MediaGallery` drag-to-reorder no longer pushes `reorder_images` to the host
  LiveView (where it had no handler and crashed the page). The grid now passes
  `target` to `<.draggable_list>` so the event reaches the component's own
  `handle_event/3`.
- `MediaBrowser` breadcrumbs no longer duplicate the current folder or ignore
  scope; move-to-root now works under scope; `update_folder/3` guarded against
  `parent_uuid: nil`; N+1 in session breadcrumb work eliminated (PR #544).
- `admin_page_header` no longer carries an unused `Icon` import left by the
  back-button removal — restores a clean `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`.
- `Utils.Values.blank_to_nil/1` and `presence/1` no longer raise on non-string
  input (e.g. a list from a `key[]=` query param) — they fall back to pass-through
  and `nil` respectively.
- V120 migration review fixes — primary-key defaults, multi-prefix guards, exact
  legacy category mapping, `uuid_generate_v7()` per house convention (PR #545).
- Avatar dropdown overflow, scroll, hover, and click-feedback fixes.

### i18n
- Ecommerce gettext manifest + `ru` / `et` translations; fixed 91 fuzzy ecommerce
  translations (PR #547).
- Projects + comments gettext manifests with `et` / `ru` translations (PR #542).
- Global Gettext locale synced alongside the backend-specific one.

## 1.7.111 - 2026-05-14

### Added
- V118 migration: callout + text annotation kinds + optional `title` column on `phoenix_kit_annotations` (PR #541)
  - Widens `phoenix_kit_annotations_kind_check` to include `"callout"` (leader-line annotation: anchor point + line to a labeled bbox) and `"text"` (freestanding click-drag text label). Both new tools shipped in Etcher 0.2; the CHECK update is folded into a single `DROP + ADD` so we don't take two trips over the same constraint
  - Adds nullable `title varchar(200)` column. Every kind can carry a short label — renders inline on the shape (above the bbox for rect/circle/polygon, at the leader endpoint for callout, inside the bbox for text). Length matches the schema-side `validate_length(:title, max: 200)`. Lives in its own column so it stays queryable outside the JSONB blob
  - `Annotation` schema gains `:title` field + the two new kinds in `@kinds`; `@cast_fields` allows it through the changeset
- `PhoenixKit.Annotations.restore_linked_comments/3` (PR #541)
  - Undo-of-delete support: when an annotation deletion is reversed via Etcher's undo stack, the original uuid is gone but the soft-deleted comments still reference it through `metadata.annotation_uuid`. The function flips matching `status: "deleted"` comments back to `"published"` and rewrites their `metadata.annotation_uuid` to point at the recreated row. Returns count restored. No-ops cleanly when PhoenixKitComments isn't installed
- `AnnotationComposer` title input (PR #541)
  - Optional title field above the comment textarea. Title-only annotations are now allowed (skips the comment-thread create entirely; the row gets only its `title` column set). `update_draft` accepts both `comment` and `title` keys, debounced 500ms each. Title persistence threaded through `:annotation_composer_posted` → `MediaBrowser.finalize_annotation_compose/3`
- `MediaBrowser` etcher 0.2 wiring (PR #541)
  - `etcher:updated` now accepts any combination of `geometry / style / metadata / title` in one payload (previously geometry-only). In-memory annotation list mirrors writes so the tooltip reflects the new title without waiting for a `load_annotations_for/1` round-trip
  - Composer popover suppressed for `kind == "text"` (content arrives inline via etcher's foreignObject editor) and `restore: true` (recreated row already has its title/metadata; user wasn't trying to create a new annotation)
  - On `restore: true` + `restore_from_uuid`, walks soft-deleted comments via `restore_linked_comments/3` and refreshes the comments sidebar
  - Tool list extended: `[:rectangle, :circle, :polygon, :freehand, :callout, :text, :eraser]`
  - Etcher overlay now attaches to the Fresco viewer even when Tessera has no sources (pre-PR: an empty `tessera_sources(f)` fell back to a plain `<img>` with no annotation overlay at all). Annotations now work on fresh uploads that haven't been through the variant generator
- `ViewerKeydown` JS hook (PR #541)
  - Replaces `phx-window-keydown="viewer_keydown"` on the viewer modal. Two filters the stock binding couldn't express: (1) only `Escape` / `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` reach the server (letter keys no longer spam LV logs), (2) navigation keys suppressed while focus is in `<input>` / `<textarea>` / contenteditable so arrow keys move the text caret instead of flipping the modal to the next image while typing
- Post-merge review doc in `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/541-v118-callout-text-etcher-0.2/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` with finding disposition table

### Changed
- `{:etcher, "~> 0.1"}` → `{:etcher, "~> 0.2"}` — adds callout / text / eraser tools, undo/redo, satellite titles, and a complete `window.Etcher.layerFor(id)` programmatic control surface (PR #541)
- `AnnotationComposer` textarea `phx-debounce` 150 → 500ms — quieter LV logs at typical typing speed, no perceived input lag (PR #541)
- `priv/static/assets/phoenix_kit.js` strips 584 lines of inlined fresco / tessera / etcher hooks. Parent apps now import each lib's own `priv/static/` bundle ahead of `phoenix_kit.js`, and phoenix_kit adopts `window.{Fresco,Tessera,Etcher}Hooks` into `window.PhoenixKitHooks`. Eliminates drift between the inlined snapshot and the hex packages (PR #541)

### Hygiene
- Lockfile updates: `fresco 0.1.1 → 0.1.2`

## 1.7.110 - 2026-05-13

### Added
- V117 migration: document composition tables for `phoenix_kit_document_creator` (PR #539)
  - Adds nullable `category :: varchar` column + index to `phoenix_kit_doc_templates` so templates self-classify (financial / technical / etc.) and the template grid can filter by scope
  - Creates `phoenix_kit_doc_document_sections` — join table snapshotting `(document_uuid, template_uuid, position, variable_values, image_params)` for every section of every composed document. `document_uuid → :delete_all` cascades sections with their parent; `template_uuid → :nilify_all` lets sections outlive the template (regenerate-required state). Unique `(document_uuid, position)` + lookup index on `(document_uuid)`
  - Creates `phoenix_kit_doc_template_presets` — named reusable section recipes scoped via `(scope_type, scope_id)` and optionally categorized. `sections` is a JSONB array of `[%{template_uuid, position, variable_values, image_params}]`. Index on `(scope_type, scope_id, category)`
  - Legacy `Document.template_uuid` column retained: composed docs leave it `NULL`, legacy single-template docs continue to use it

### Fixed
- Fixed ungrouped `handle_event/3` clauses in `MediaBrowser` by relocating `creator_attrs/2` helper to private-helpers block
- Restored sitemap dynamic `<lastmod>` for homepage and group listing pages (`Sources.Static`, `Sources.Publishing`)
  - PR #539's merge silently re-removed `static_lastmod/1` and `latest_post_date/2` (a zombie revert that came back via merge conflict and got cut again from a behind-the-base fork). Result: every static URL was reporting `lastmod: <today>` on every crawl (a known false-freshness signal Google de-prioritizes), and every group listing was shipping without `<lastmod>` at all
  - Homepage `<lastmod>` now uses a new lightweight `Publishing.latest_post_date_global/0` helper — single pass over each group's posts to take max `published_at`. Replaces the prior shape that called `Publishing.collect/1` and threw away everything except the `:lastmod` field (which triggered ~3× redundant `list_posts/2` calls per group inside `collect/1`)

### Hygiene
- Routine lockfile updates (`mix.lock`)
- Precommit: `compile --force` replaced with `compile --warnings-as-errors --all-warnings`, added `deps.unlock --check-unused`, switched from `quality` to `quality.ci` (format-check)
- Dialyzer: removed 5 unused ignore filters (css_integration, process_scheduled_jobs_worker, duplicate conn_case/data_case, integrations guard_fail)
- Removed stale `:phoenix_kit` self-entry from `mix.lock`

## 1.7.109 - 2026-05-12

### Added
- V114 migration: Integrations storage switched to uuid-only `key` column on `phoenix_kit_settings` (PR #536)
  - Collapses the per-row `key` from the composite `integration:<provider>:<name>` shape to just the row's UUIDv7. Lifts both name restrictions baked into the old shape: the regex `[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-_]*` and per-provider uniqueness are gone. Any non-empty string (after trim) is now a valid connection name; duplicates within a provider coexist (uuids disambiguate). Names with spaces, punctuation, "My Company Drive (US)" — all allowed
  - `add_connection/3`: generates UUIDv7 up-front, embeds it in both the `uuid` and `key` columns; provider + name live purely in `value_json`. `rename_connection/3` rewrites only the JSONB `name` field — storage key is the row uuid, untouched across renames, so consumer modules pinning to uuid keep working
  - Read sites (`get_integration_by_uuid/1`, `list_connections/1`, `load_all_connections/1`) source provider + name from JSONB; the list helpers expose `:date_added` so UI callers render "Created N ago" without a second lookup
  - `provider:name` string lookups now first-match by case-insensitive name sort (names aren't unique anymore). Read-shim contract preserved for legacy `migrate_legacy/0` callsites
  - `log_activity` takes explicit `(provider, name)` so audit rows carry human-readable names — parsing the key would have stamped a uuid string into `metadata.connection`
  - Migration walks every `integration:%`-keyed row in a single UPDATE, backfills missing `value_json -> 'name'` / `'provider'`, ensures `module = 'integrations'`, and rewrites `key = uuid::text`. Legacy V0-shape keys without `:name` fold to `name = "default"`. `down/1` rewrites back to composite shape with `-<8-char>` suffix from UUIDv7's random tail on duplicate `(provider, name)` pairs
- V115 migration: `phoenix_kit_annotations` table for drawn-on-image shapes via the Etcher overlay (PR #537)
  - Stores rectangle / circle / polygon / freehand shapes tied to a `phoenix_kit_files` row in image-pixel coordinates. Geometry is JSONB; shape kinds enforced via DB-level CHECK constraint matching Etcher 0.1's four-tool set
  - `file_uuid` FK `ON DELETE :delete_all` — annotations vanish with their host image. `creator_uuid` nullable + `ON DELETE :nilify_all` so user deletion preserves their annotations as anonymous
  - Discussion threads attach via the existing comments convention: comments anchored to the **file** (`resource_type = "file"`, `resource_uuid = file_uuid`) with `metadata.annotation_uuid` carrying the back-reference. Annotation-rooted comments appear in the file's main thread alongside non-annotated discussion
  - Indexes: `(file_uuid)` for per-file listing, partial `(creator_uuid) WHERE creator_uuid IS NOT NULL` for author lookups
- V116 migration: nullable self-FK `parent_uuid` on `phoenix_kit_entity_data` (PR #538)
  - Each entity-data row can point at another row of the same entity as its parent. System field — always present, optional, never user-removable (does not appear in `entities.fields_definition`). Existing rows stay `parent_uuid = NULL` and become roots; no backfill
  - No `ON DELETE` cascade — parent/child linkage and same-entity scope are managed by the `PhoenixKitEntities.EntityData` context inside a transaction. A DB-level cascade would bypass the soft-delete machinery and the activity log
  - Same-entity enforcement is a context-layer responsibility. B-tree index on `(parent_uuid)` covers the "list children" query for the WordPress-style indented tree
- `PhoenixKit.Annotations` context + `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.EtcherAdapter` (PR #537)
  - Context handles CRUD against `phoenix_kit_annotations` plus `list_for_file_with_previews/1` that pulls every file comment in a single bulk query and groups by `metadata.annotation_uuid` for the tooltip preview
  - `Annotations.delete/1` runs comment cascade + annotation row delete in a `Repo.transaction/1` so a failure between the two doesn't leave the annotation alive with its discussion thread destroyed
  - `Annotation.adapter_writable_fields/0` exposes the schema's `@cast_fields` (minus `file_uuid`, which the adapter sets server-side from `target_uuid`) as the source of truth for the adapter whitelist — the adapter's `@schema_keys` derives from it so a future schema field can't drift silently
  - `EtcherAdapter` implements the `Etcher.Storage` behaviour, dispatching to the context. Adapter explicitly whitelists payload keys before reaching `String.to_existing_atom` — guards against forward-compat with Etcher's payload shape growing new client-side keys
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.AnnotationComposer` LiveComponent (PR #537)
  - Focused composer for attaching the first comment to a newly-drawn annotation. Explicit Post / Cancel control flow owns the annotation lifecycle: Post commits comment + solidifies annotation, Cancel rolls the annotation back. Communicates with the parent MediaBrowser via LC-to-LC `send_update/2`, no host-LV plumbing required
  - Scope: text + file uploads (image / video / audio / pdf / archive) + Giphy picker. Audio recording (which the full `CommentsComponent` supports) intentionally skipped for v1
- MediaBrowser integration with the Etcher overlay (PR #537)
  - `Etcher.layer` mounted alongside `Fresco.viewer` in the modal. New `etcher:created` / `:updated` / `:deleted` / `:selected` handlers wire the JS overlay into the storage backend
  - Lifecycle: `open_viewer/2` preloads annotations + rolls back any pending compose; `finalize_annotation_compose/2` reloads annotations and pokes the file's `CommentsComponent` to refresh; `refresh_file_comments/1` flips the component's `loaded?` to false to trigger a sidebar reload
  - `creator_uuid` is set server-side from the scope — client-supplied `creator_uuid` in the payload is overridden, preventing author spoofing
- `IntegrationPicker` rewrite (PR #536)
  - Card subtitle: priority `external_account_id` → masked credential tail (first 8 + `…` + last 4 for any of `api_key` / `bot_token` / `access_key`; `•••` for keys under 14 chars)
  - Age line under subtitle using shared `<.time_ago>`
  - Status badge: distinct label + colour for each of the four canonical statuses (`connected` → green "Connected", `error` → red "Auth failed" with `validation_status` tooltip, `configured` → yellow "Not tested", `disconnected` → grey "Not connected")
  - Provider icon + display name auto-resolve via `Integrations.Providers.get/1` — callers no longer pre-attach a `:provider` struct
  - Provider-name badge hidden when picker is filtered to a single provider (both real callsites do this)
  - Click feedback: `phx-click-loading` dims the clicked card + blocks rapid re-clicks during the LV round-trip; daisyUI `loading-spinner` swaps in for the status badge during the same window
  - `provider_def` memoized in a `Map.new(connections, ...)` shared between `filter_by_search/3` and the render path — drops `Providers.get/1` calls from 2N to N per render
  - 33 new component spec tests covering subtitle priority + masked credential + age + provider auto-resolve + status branches + filter-by-provider + search threshold + empty state + deleted-card warning + click-action dispatch
- `<.draggable_list>` `:sortable_handle` attribute (PR #538)
  - Optional CSS selector (e.g. `".pk-drag-handle"`) that restricts drag initiation to elements matching the selector inside each item. When set, the item wrapper drops `cursor-grab` styling — the caller renders their own handle. Backward-compatible: default `nil` preserves whole-item drag. Mirrors `<.table_default>`'s `:on_reorder` + `.pk-drag-handle` convention. JS hook (`SortableGrid`) already supported `data-sortable-handle`; this PR wires the Elixir-side knob through
- Etcher tooltip JS slot overrides (PR #537)
  - `window.Etcher.tooltipSlots` `.header` / `.footer` / `.body` translate `metadata.comment_*` keys into the rich tooltip (author header, date · count subheader, thumbnail + quoted text body). `window.Etcher = window.Etcher || {}` guards against load order
- `AnnotationComposerPosition` JS hook keeping the MediaBrowser's floating annotation-composer popover inside the viewer bounds via re-clamping on mount + updates + window resize
- Dep adds: `:fresco ~> 0.1` (OpenSeadragon viewer wrapper, now a direct dep since Tessera 0.2 split it out), `:etcher ~> 0.1` (annotation overlay)
- Three post-merge review docs in `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/`: `536-integrations-v114-uuid-keys-picker-ux/`, `537-annotations-v115-etcher-overlay/`, `538-v116-parent-uuid-draggable-handle/` — each with finding disposition tables tracking which items were addressed in follow-up commits and which were deferred to the original PR author

### Changed
- `Integrations.validate_connection/2` rescue narrowed to `[DBConnection.OwnershipError, Postgrex.Error, Req.TransportError]` so genuine logic bugs (`KeyError`, `ArgumentError`, `MatchError`) bubble up to the supervisor instead of being swallowed under a generic "validation failed". `validate_credentials/2` mirrored the narrowing post-merge for parity (PR #536)
- `Integrations.authenticated_request/4` docstring spells out the URL-trust contract: the integration's Bearer token is attached to every request, so callers must pin URLs to a domain allowlist before invoking. Internal callers (`OpenRouterClient`, OAuth refresh, userinfo) build URLs from the Providers registry which is hardcoded and safe; new callsites taking URLs from elsewhere need their own guard (PR #536)
- `phx-disable-with` on Save / Test Connection / Disconnect / Delete buttons on `integration_form.html.heex` plus the OAuth Connect Account button. Pre-fix, a double-click + slow network could submit two save requests or spawn parallel HTTP probes (PR #536)
- IntegrationForm `create_connection` + `save_form_with_rename` error branches preserve `:new_name` + `:form_values` on error so a failed `:empty_name` submit doesn't wipe the api_key the operator just typed. Dropped the dead `:already_exists` / `:invalid_name` error branches (those tuples no longer fire post-V114). Template: removed the now-incorrect "Letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. Must be unique per provider." name-rules hint (PR #536)
- `PhoenixKit.Users.Permissions.module_label("db")` / `module_icon` / `module_description` pin `db` in `@core_*` maps so the display is correct even when the external `phoenix_kit_db` module isn't loaded (PR #536)
- `MediaBrowser.format_date/1` strftime format string wrapped in `gettext(...)` so locales can reorder date components (`%d %b %Y` for en-GB / fr / de) without code changes
- `AnnotationComposer.first_error/1` routes through `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.Input.translate_error/1` — gettext-aware helper that interpolates `%{count}` and other opts properly
- `AGENTS.md` CHANGELOG-ownership instruction corrected — entries are written by agents against the bumped `@version` heading, matching the project's actual workflow

### Fixed
- Post-merge fixes folded from review of PR #536:
  - V114 docstring drift after rebase rename: moduledoc references "V113" but the module is V114; "Stamp the table comment with '113'" while code stamps '114'; "post-V113 regression / invariant" in tests and picker comment. All swept to V114
  - `Permissions.module_label("db")` was falling through to `String.capitalize("db")` = `"Db"` when the external `phoenix_kit_db` module isn't loaded; test asserts `"DB"`. Folded in to keep the post-rebase baseline green
  - Test fixture rows in `storage/scope_test.exs`, `media_browser_scope_test.exs`, `media_browser_test.exs` violated V113's `phoenix_kit_files_user_or_parent_check` CHECK constraint; each `create_file!/1` now stamps `user_uuid` via a memoised `ensure_user!/0` helper
  - `IntegrationPicker.filter_by_search/3` had a shadowing `name` variable in the inner case pattern match; renamed to `provider_name`
  - `String.slice` negative-bound range pinned with explicit step (`-4..-1//1`) to silence Elixir 1.16+ range-step warning
  - Credo cleanup: `get_integration/1` 2-branch `cond` with `true` arm → `if/else`; inline `PhoenixKit.Settings.Queries.get_setting_by_uuid/1` calls aliased as `SettingsQueries` in `integrations_test.exs`; three test files (`storage/scope_test.exs`, `media_browser_scope_test.exs`, `media_browser_test.exs`) alias `PhoenixKit.Users.Auth` for their `ensure_user!` helpers
- Post-merge fixes folded from review of PR #537:
  - `Annotations.delete/1` deleted linked comments outside a transaction — if the comment cascade succeeded and the annotation row delete then failed (FK violation, DB transient), comments were gone but the annotation remained with its discussion permanently destroyed. Wrapped in `Repo.transaction/1` via an extracted `delete_in_transaction/1` helper
  - `resource_type = "annotation"` claim in three moduledocs (`annotation.ex`, `v115.ex`, `etcher_adapter.ex`) contradicted the actual implementation, which anchors comments to the **file** (`resource_type = "file"`) with `metadata.annotation_uuid`. All docs swept to match reality
  - `Annotations.delete_linked_comments/1` bare `rescue _ -> :ok` swallowed every exception class including logic bugs. Narrowed to `[DBConnection.OwnershipError, Postgrex.Error, ArgumentError]` so logic bugs surface
  - `AnnotationComposer.normalize/1` reinvented what `Ecto.Changeset.cast/3` already does (accepts both atom- and string-keyed maps) AND silently passed the original map through when `String.to_existing_atom` failed, hiding typo'd field names from the user as "geometry: can't be blank" rather than "unknown field" — function deleted
  - In-repo `Code.ensure_loaded?(PhoenixKit.Annotations)` guard in `MediaBrowser.load_annotations_for/1` was needless defensive code — `Annotations` is in the same compilation unit
  - `@compile {:no_warn_undefined, [PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage, ...]}` would have shadowed legitimate compile errors on a core module rename — `Storage` removed from the suppression list
  - `AnnotationComposerPosition.destroyed` cleanup conditional was a never-falls-through guard — simplified
  - Etcher slot-preservation JS comment misstated the mechanism — corrected to "PhoenixKit owns the tooltip layout; downstream consumers must load AFTER phoenix_kit.js"
  - Credo cleanup: `Annotations.first_attachment_thumbnail/1` single-clause `with` → `case`; aliased `Annotations`, `Storage`, `EtcherAdapter`, `Storage.File` so six "nested modules could be aliased" findings clear
  - PhoenixKitComments dialyzer ignores added for `annotations.ex` + `annotation_composer.ex` (optional sibling package, guarded at runtime)
- V114 down SQL collision-suffix source: `substring(uuid::text from 1 for 8)` extracted UUIDv7's timestamp prefix — same-millisecond rows produced identical suffixes ⇒ duplicate "uniquified" keys when two+ rows collided on `(provider, name)`. Switched to `substring(uuid::text from 25 for 8)` (random tail, 32 bits of entropy). Mirrored in `run_down!` in the V114 test (PR #538 follow-up)
- 3-row collision test added to V114 test suite covering N ≥ 3 case (exactly one plain key, N-1 distinct suffixed keys, all keys unique)
- IntegrationPicker click feedback was missing: clicking a card showed no visual response during the 100-500ms LV round-trip — operators would click again and submit a second request. Added `phx-click-loading:opacity-60 phx-click-loading:pointer-events-none` + status-badge → spinner swap during the in-flight window (PR #536)

### i18n
- AnnotationComposer user-facing strings wrapped in gettext (flash messages + heex literals + ARIA labels — ~17 strings)
- MediaBrowser `format_date` strftime pattern wrapped in gettext so locales reorder date components
- IntegrationPicker status labels (`Connected` / `Auth failed` / `Not tested` / `Not connected`) and search placeholder + empty-state strings wrapped in gettext
- IntegrationForm flash messages, button labels, name placeholder, danger-zone copy, OAuth step labels, redirect-uri instructions wrapped in gettext


## 1.7.108 - 2026-05-11

### Added
- V112 migration: `phoenix_kit_projects*` schema evolution (PR #533)
  - `archived_at TIMESTAMP(0)` on `phoenix_kit_projects` so the admin dashboard can soft-hide projects without flipping a status enum. Mirrors the workspace convention used by `phoenix_kit_publishing`'s `posts.trashed_at` and `phoenix_kit_files.trashed_at` — null = visible, non-null = soft-hidden, with the timestamp doubling as audit metadata. Existing `status = 'archived'` rows backfilled into `archived_at` so the dashboard filters keep working transparently
  - `phoenix_kit_projects_visible_idx` partial index on `(inserted_at DESC) WHERE archived_at IS NULL` — one partial covers both project-list and template-list dashboard reads (neither view shows archived rows)
  - `translations JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` on `phoenix_kit_projects`, `phoenix_kit_project_tasks`, `phoenix_kit_project_assignments` for per-language overrides on user-input content (name / description / title). Primary stays in dedicated columns; JSONB only carries non-primary overrides
  - `position INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` on `phoenix_kit_projects` and `phoenix_kit_project_tasks` so the drag-and-drop reorder API can persist manual ordering. Existing rows fold into the `0` bucket and the schema's secondary order-by-`inserted_at` kicks in until a user actually drags
  - `scheduled_start_date` retyped from `DATE` to `TIMESTAMP(0)` so scheduled-overdue detection honors time-of-day (a project scheduled for today 09:00 flips to `:overdue` at 09:01, not at midnight). Column name kept — lying name + honest type beats the churn of renaming every call site
  - Drops the three remaining unique-name indexes — `phoenix_kit_projects_name_template_index`, `phoenix_kit_projects_name_project_index`, `phoenix_kit_project_tasks_title_index`. Name uniqueness is now policy, not schema — editing or duplicating names no longer trips a stale index, and future renames don't need migration coordination
  - Bumps migrator `@current_version` 111 → 112 — without this V112 was dead code
  - All steps idempotent (column-existence, index-existence, USING coercion clauses); `down/1` reverses each change so a rollback restores the V111 shape. `down/1` restores the V105/V101 unique indexes **first**, before dropping any V112 columns, so a duplicate-name conflict at rollback aborts cleanly rather than leaving a half-rolled schema
- `test/phoenix_kit/migrations/v112_test.exs` — pins every V112 addition (archived_at column + type + nullability, visible-index existence AND predicate shape, translations JSONB on the three tables, scheduled_start_date retype, position columns) plus the four dropped indexes and the duplicate-name behavior. The predicate test refutes any `is_template` mention, closing the docs-drift loop
- `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/533-v112-projects-schema-evolution/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` — post-merge review with finding dispositions
- V113 migration: system-managed media flag for Tessera deep-zoom tiles + comments↔files junction (PR #534)
  - `system_managed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` on `phoenix_kit_files` — marks internally-generated media (DZI tile pyramids + per-tile chunks) so the MediaBrowser excludes them from user listings and the variant generator skips them (tile chunks don't need small / medium / large — just an `"original"` FileInstance)
  - `parent_file_uuid UUID` nullable FK to `phoenix_kit_files(uuid)` ON DELETE CASCADE — system-managed tile rows cascade away when their source image is hard-deleted
  - `user_uuid` drops NOT NULL — system-managed rows belong to a parent File, not a user. The DB-level CHECK `phoenix_kit_files_user_or_parent_check` enforces "`user_uuid IS NOT NULL OR parent_file_uuid IS NOT NULL`" so raw inserts can't violate the invariant
  - `phoenix_kit_files_system_dedup_index` partial unique index on `(parent_file_uuid, file_name) WHERE system_managed = true` — concurrent lazy-generation requests for the same uncached tile dedupe at the DB level via the changeset's `unique_constraint`; `Storage.store_system_file/3` recovers the winner's row on conflict
  - Two more partial indexes — `phoenix_kit_files_parent_uuid_index` (per-source lookup + cascade-cleanup) and `phoenix_kit_files_system_managed_index` (keeps the MediaBrowser's "user files only" sort cheap as the tile catalog grows)
  - `phoenix_kit_comment_media` junction table letting the comments module attach core File rows to comments with position + caption. Cascade on `comment_uuid`, RESTRICT on `file_uuid` (a file can't hard-delete while attached). Consumer code lands in a later PR
  - Bumps migrator `@current_version` 112 → 113; all DDL idempotent via `IF NOT EXISTS` / DO-blocks
- Deep Zoom Image viewer in MediaBrowser via Tessera (OpenSeadragon wrapper, PR #534)
  - New `Tessera.Viewer.viewer` replaces the static `<img>` in the file modal; `tessera_sources/1` builds the progressive layer list (medium → optional large → DZI manifest)
  - `<Tessera.Storage>` adapter (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.TesseraAdapter`) lands tile writes in the storage pipeline (multi-bucket via `Manager.store_file/2` + a system-managed File row via `Storage.store_system_file/3`)
  - Two new public endpoints — `/tiles/:token/:dzi_filename` and `/tiles/:token/:files_segment/:level/:tile_filename` — generate the DZI manifest and individual tiles **lazily** on first request, then serve from storage. Signed `URLSigner` token in the URL path (not query) so OpenSeadragon's tile-URL derivation preserves it across manifest → tile fetch. The "dzi" variant name is distinct from storage variants so a leaked file-serving token can't grant tile access. Unauthorized requests return 404 to prevent UUID enumeration
  - Per-`file_uuid` `:global.set_lock` mutex + double-checked locking around the generators serializes concurrent cold-path requests for the same image; different images stay parallel. Lock timeout surfaces as 503 + `Retry-After` header
  - Tempfile lifecycles wrapped in `try/after` so `Tessera.generate_tile/4` or `Manager.retrieve_file/2` exceptions don't leak files into `System.tmp_dir!()`
  - New storage setting `storage_tile_generation_enabled` (default `"false"`) is the kill switch — when off, MediaBrowser emits no manifest URLs and the tile endpoints return 404
- `Storage.store_system_file/3` — context helper for system-managed media (tiles, manifests). Idempotent: check-then-insert with unique-violation recovery via the new dedup index, so two concurrent writers for the same key both end up with the same row
- `Storage` query helper `exclude_system_managed/1` — applied to every `list_*` / `count_*` / orphan / trash query so system-managed rows are invisible in the MediaBrowser regardless of how the query is composed
- `test/phoenix_kit/migrations/v113_test.exs` — pins every V113 addition (system_managed column shape, parent_file_uuid FK with cascade verification, user_uuid nullability change, three indexes including the partial-unique dedup, CHECK constraint with a raw-SQL test that double-null inserts are rejected, comment_media table + its two indexes)
- `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/534-media-browser-tessera-tiles/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` — review with finding dispositions; CRITICAL + HIGH items fixed in the same release

### Changed
- `<.translatable_field>` in `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MultilangForm` — wrapper now `flex flex-col gap-1` and base input/textarea classes carry `w-full` (commits `52856738`, `0412beaf`). daisyUI 5's `.label` is `inline-flex` and `.input`/`.textarea` are `inline-block`, so without forcing column direction here label and field sat on the same row. Aligns the multilang form's layout with the regular `<.input>` core component
- `test/phoenix_kit/migrations/v106_test.exs` — dropped the "schema state (verified at boot)" `describe` block (its assertions pinned V112's drops, not V106's adds — moved to `V112Test`). File now scoped to V106's `down/1` cross-mode duplicate pre-check, matching its filename

### Fixed
- V112 `down/1` rollback ordering (post-merge review fix, commit `0cde04a8`). Original `down/1` dropped columns before restoring unique indexes; if post-V112 work introduced any duplicate names (V112's whole purpose), the `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` would raise mid-rollback after columns were already gone. Reordered so index restoration runs first
- V112 visible-index predicate docs/code alignment — migrator moduledoc claimed `WHERE archived_at IS NULL AND is_template = false` but actual index only filtered on `archived_at IS NULL`. Docs updated to match the emitted SQL with rationale (one partial covers both visible projects and visible templates)
- MediaBrowser i18n — list-view dropdown duplicates of the folder menu (Color heading, delete data-confirm, Delete button) were missed in the original sweep; wrapped so list view matches grid view. Three flash/confirm messages embedded two independent counts in a single `gettext` call which made correct pluralization impossible in Russian (3 forms) and Estonian (2 forms); each composed from two `ngettext` calls injected into the surrounding `gettext` template (PR #532)

### i18n
- MediaBrowser UI strings wrapped in gettext + Russian and Estonian translations (PRs #532, plus earlier commits `c717c9d0` / `d44bf95c`)
- `/admin/modules` page strings wrapped in gettext + ru/et translations (PR #530)
- Core sidebar tabs wired to `PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext` for ru/et (PR #529, commits `43e528ac` / `c5fd5bae`)
- Sitemap settings UI strings wrapped in gettext (commit `afcc281a`)
- General Settings widened + `/admin/modules/languages` strings wrapped (commit `24ceec90`)
- Core `badge.ex` + `time_display.ex` status strings wrapped (commit `1fe0ad78`)
- 9 new tab-label msgids + complete Estonian translation in `default.po` (commit `373478f5`)
- Bare `Active` badge in `users.html.heex:278` wrapped (commit `8a341e90`)

### Layout
- Admin settings pages widened for wide screens (commit `3ea70ec1`)
- Module settings pages — sitemap, storage, referrals — widened for wide screens (commit `d867cb57`)

### Hygiene
- `mix format` reflow of long-line `gettext` / `ngettext` / `put_flash` calls in `media_browser.ex` and `media_browser.html.heex` (commit `9841ac31`). Surfaced when `mix precommit` ran during V112 review-followup work; no semantic changes
- New Hex dep: `{:tessera, "~> 0.1"}` — OpenSeadragon wrapper used by the Deep Zoom viewer

## 1.7.107 - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Two opt-in stateless helpers on `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.TableDefault` (PR #528)
  - `sort_header_cell/1` — clickable `<th>` with `hero-chevron-up-mini`/`-down-mini` icon when active, inert label-only `<th>` when `sort` attr is `nil`. Configurable `event` (default `"toggle_sort"`), `target`, `align` (`:left`/`:right`/`:center`). The `align` is applied to the `<th class>` (`text-right` / `text-center`) so non-sortable columns honour it consistently with the sortable ones
  - `sort_header_cell/1` emits `aria-sort="ascending"|"descending"|"none"` on the `<th>` when sortable, omitted when inert. Pinned by 4 regression tests covering all three states + omitted
  - `search_toolbar/1` — daisyUI `input-sm` with `hero-magnifying-glass` icon and `phx-debounce` (default 300ms). Optional `<form>` wrap when `on_submit` is set. Placeholder defaults to `dgettext("default", "Search...")`. `phx-target` propagates to both the `<form>` and `<input>` so submit-on-Enter retargets correctly when embedded in a `LiveComponent`
  - `test/phoenix_kit_web/components/core/table_default_test.exs` — new directory + 18 component tests; closes part of the standing `core/` test-coverage TODO from `CLAUDE.md`
- `change_page` event handler in `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Users.LiveSessions` — pagination on `/admin/users/live-sessions` was bound to `phx-click="goto_page"` with no matching `handle_event/3` clause, so clicking any page number raised `FunctionClauseError` and crashed the LV (PR #528 follow-up). Renamed the binding to `change_page` and added the handler mirroring the sibling `users.ex:121` convention

### Changed
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Users.LiveSessions` — collapsed `:sort_by` + `:sort_order` assigns into a single `:sort = %{by, dir}` map; renamed event `"sort_by"` → `"toggle_sort"` with `"by"` param. First click on a new column sorts ascending (was descending); subsequent clicks toggle. `flip_dir/1` tightened from `flip_dir(_)` catch-all to explicit `:desc` clause so unintended values surface as a crash rather than silent coercion (PR #528)
- `lib/phoenix_kit_web/live/users/live_sessions.html.heex` and `lib/phoenix_kit_web/live/users/users.html.heex` — both call sites of `<.search_toolbar>` dropped the redundant `on_submit="search"`. The input's debounced `phx-change="search"` already covers the same event; keeping both made Enter fire `"search"` twice (immediate submit + 300ms-later debounced change) (PR #528 follow-up)

### Fixed
- `lib/phoenix_kit_web/live/users/users.html.heex` — replaced bare search form (every keystroke hit the server) with `<.search_toolbar>` carrying the 300ms `phx-debounce` (PR #528)
- `<.search_toolbar>` form variant double-bound `phx-change` on both `<form>` and `<input>`, doubling work per keystroke. `phx-change` is now bound only on the `<input>`; the `<form>` carries `phx-submit` only. `phx-target` now propagates to both so LiveComponent embedding works end-to-end. Two regression tests pin both behaviours (PR #528, commit `dfc91238`)

### i18n
- `mix gettext.extract --merge` resync — adds `"Search..."` msgid + `et` / `ru` translations and surfaces accumulated drift from prior commits where extract wasn't run (PR #528, separate commit `a7c1d35b`)

### Hygiene
- `.gitignore` — adds `/priv/static/assets/vendor/` so `mix phoenix_kit.install` runs against `/app` itself don't leave an outdated copy of the source JS in tree (PR #528)
- `mix.lock` — `db_connection` 2.10.0 → 2.10.1, `igniter` 0.7.9 → 0.8.0 (pulls in `ex_ast` 0.11.0 as new transitive). Routine patch bumps

## 1.7.106 - 2026-05-08

### Added
- V111 migration: PDF library tables for the upcoming catalogue PDF subtab (PR #516)
  - `phoenix_kit_cat_pdfs` — thin per-upload row. `file_uuid` FK to `phoenix_kit_files(uuid)` ON DELETE RESTRICT (catalogue manages the file lifecycle; core prune can't remove files referenced by a live catalogue row). Soft-delete via `status` sentinel (`active` / `trashed`) + `trashed_at`. Two uploads of identical content (different filenames) → two rows sharing one `phoenix_kit_files` row + one extraction
  - `phoenix_kit_cat_pdf_extractions` — keyed by `file_uuid` PK. Worker state machine (`pending → extracting → extracted | scanned_no_text | failed`) + `page_count` + `extracted_at` + `error_message`. Cascades on file hard delete
  - `phoenix_kit_cat_pdf_page_contents` — content-addressed dedup cache. PK on `content_hash` (SHA-256 hex of normalized page text). Same page text across multiple PDFs is stored once. GIN trigram index lives here so the search index doesn't grow with cross-PDF duplication
  - `phoenix_kit_cat_pdf_pages` — composite PK `(file_uuid, page_number)`; `content_hash` FK to the dedup cache (RESTRICT — orphaned content rows GC'd by a catalogue-side helper, not by FK cascade)
  - Enables `pg_trgm` extension; `@current_version` 110 → 111
- `PhoenixKit.KnownPackages` — live catalog of known external PhoenixKit packages, replacing the previously hardcoded list in `ModuleRegistry.known_external_packages/0` (PR #523)
  - Fetched on demand from `https://hex.pm/api/packages?search=phoenix_kit_&sort=name` and cached for 10 minutes in an ETS named table (`:phoenix_kit_known_packages_cache`)
  - Stale-while-revalidate with cap: on Hex failure, serves cached data up to `:max_stale_age_ms` (default 24h); beyond that, drops the cache and falls back to `:extra_known_packages` config entries only
  - `:warning` log on stale-served and empty-cache-extras-only; `:error` log when cache exceeds max stale age — operationally distinct alert levels
  - `Link`-header pagination with a 20-page cap (`@max_pages`) so a malformed `Link` header pointing back to the same page can't loop forever
  - `extra_known_packages` config knob — parent apps with private/forked packages declare them inline and they take precedence over Hex entries on the `package` dedup key (`source: "config"` baked in)
  - `hex_docs_icon_name: hero-<name>` convention — package authors append the marker to their Hex package description and the catalog UI picks it up; default is `hero-puzzle-piece`
- Per-module gettext support on Dashboard sidebar labels and tooltips (PR #522)
  - `PhoenixKit.Dashboard.Tab` gains `gettext_backend: module() | nil` (default `nil`) and `gettext_domain: String.t()` (default `"default"`) fields, plus `localized_label/1` and `localized_tooltip/1` resolvers that call `Gettext.dgettext/3` when a backend is set and fall back to the raw label otherwise
  - `PhoenixKit.Dashboard.Group` gains the same two fields plus `localized_label/1`
  - `Tab.divider/1` and `Tab.group_header/1` accept the new opts; `Tab.new/1` round-trips both via `get_attr/2`
  - 14 render sites in `Sidebar`, `AdminSidebar`, `TabItem` swap `tab.label` → `Tab.localized_label(tab)` and equivalents — mechanically uniform, no shape changes
  - Hot-reload safety via `Map.get/2` (not pattern matching) on the new fields — old-shape `%Tab{}` cached in ETS or `:persistent_term` from before the upgrade falls through as if `gettext_backend` were `nil` rather than raising `FunctionClauseError`. Pinned by an explicit `Map.delete(:gettext_backend)` regression test
  - `guides/per-module-i18n.md` — public guide for module developers (setup checklist, `mix.exs` / backend / `.po` flow, `dynamic_children/2` locale handling, dividers and group headers, tooltips, greenfield template, retrofitting checklist, smoke test pattern, common pitfalls including the hot-reload safety contract)
  - `dev_docs/instructions/2026-05-08-per-module-i18n-procedure.md` — internal operational procedure capturing every gotcha hit during the Newsletters pilot (skip-worktree on mix.exs, path-dep workflow during local dev, conditional CI skip pattern for graceful degradation)
- `:per_translation_urls` attr on the three `LanguageSwitcher` variants — `language_switcher_dropdown/1`, `language_switcher_buttons/1`, `language_switcher_inline/1` (PR #525)
  - Each entry is `%{code: <display_code>, url: <full_url>}`. Both atom-keyed and string-keyed entries accepted (useful when the list comes from JSON/JSONB rather than Elixir code)
  - Resolves each language's `base_code` against the list via `DialectMapper.extract_base/1` so `"en-US"` and `"en"` both resolve cleanly. Falls back to the locale-rewrite default when no entry matches OR the matched entry has a `nil` URL (e.g. an unpublished draft)
  - Useful when a feature module has computed canonical URLs that the simple locale-rewrite default can't reproduce — for example publishing's per-language URL slugs where `/en/blog/my-post` and `/fr/blog/mon-article` aren't related by segment swap. Pass `assigns[:phoenix_kit_publishing_translations]` from the layout
  - 7 new tests in `test/phoenix_kit_web/components/core/language_switcher_test.exs` pin the contract (atom-keyed, string-keyed, full-dialect normalization, per-language fallback, nil/empty/missing-attr pass-through)
- Drag-handle scoping + sortable feedback infrastructure (PR #525)
  - `<.table_default>` emits `data-sortable-handle=".pk-drag-handle"` when `@on_reorder` is set; only the `.pk-drag-handle` element gets `cursor-grab` styling. Click-to-expand / button-press / text-selection on a card no longer fights with SortableJS drag detection
  - `SortableGrid` JS hook: new `sortable:flash` LV→client event handler. The host LV pushes `{uuid: "...", status: "ok" | "error"}` after each `reorder_items` attempt; the hook applies `pk-sortable-flash-{ok,err}` class for ~1.2s, idempotent via reflow trigger. Queries every `[data-id]` element so table-view + card-view both animate. Defensive status-validation guard — unknown values bail rather than falling into the err-class branch
  - `<tr>` cell-width preservation via `onChoose` / `onUnchoose` — SortableJS's `forceFallback: true` + `fallbackOnBody: true` clones the dragged `<tr>` to `document.body`, where it loses its `<table>` ancestor and `<td>`s collapse to content width. The hook now snapshots computed widths and pins them inline before the drag preview renders; `onUnchoose` restores them
  - `data-sortable-handle` attr threads to SortableJS's `handle` option for any caller; `moved_id` always included in the `reorder_items` payload (was only on cross-container moves) so the LV can push back a `sortable:flash` keyed to the just-moved row
- MediaBrowser modal viewer becomes the default click target for non-admin / non-select_mode browsers, with read-only image / video / PDF / icon preview, metadata sidebar, Download button, prev/next chevrons (and ←/→ keyboard shortcuts), and Esc / backdrop close (PR #519)
  - Mobile-fullscreen layout via `position: fixed; inset: 0` — bypasses daisyUI's grid + iOS Safari's 100vh/100dvh quirks. Desktop reverts to `95vw × 90vh` centered modal with rounded corners. The `!`-prefix utility chain on `.modal-box` is required because daisyUI v5's defaults win the cascade over plain Tailwind utilities
  - `MediaImageZoom` JS hook lazy-loads Panzoom 4.6.0 from jsDelivr when the modal opens; image supports wheel/pinch/double-tap zoom and drag-pan. Listener attaches to the parent so the cursor doesn't have to land on the image; `destroyed` cleanup removes the wheel listener and destroys the Panzoom instance
  - Bulk-select still reachable — clicking the toolbar's Select button flips `select_mode` on, and from then on clicks toggle selection instead of opening the modal
- LiveView login redirect now carries the original request path as `?return_to=` (PR #519)
  - New `login_path_with_return_to/1` private helper in `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth` reads `Phoenix.LiveView.get_connect_info(socket, :uri)`, encodes `path?query` via `URI.encode_www_form/1`, and threads it into the redirect target. Wired into the four `redirect_require_login` paths in `on_mount` hooks
  - Trailing-slash self-loop guard: `String.trim_trailing(path, "/")` on both sides of the equality check, so `/users/log-in` and `/users/log-in/` are treated as the same path and no return-to round-trips back to itself
  - Pairs with the existing `?return_to=` flow in `login.ex` (`sanitize_return_to/1` → `:user_return_to` session → `log_in_user/3`)
- `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry.get_module_key_for_namespace/1` — symmetric with the existing `get_by_key/1`. Resolves a top-level Elixir namespace string (e.g. `"PhoenixKitEntities"`) to the registered plugin's `module_key/0` (PR #521)
  - Iterates `all_modules/0`, matches on `Module.split(mod) == [top_namespace]` (exact, single segment), returns the key string or `nil` for unmatched
  - Reads from `:persistent_term` so there's no GenServer roundtrip on the hot path
- Microsoft 365 OAuth tenant override + generic `interpolate_url/3` helper in `PhoenixKit.Integrations.OAuth` — providers can now substitute `{key}` placeholders in `auth_url` / `token_url` from per-row `integration_data`, falling back to a provider-level `:url_defaults` map (PR #516)
  - Closes the previously hardcoded `/common/` Microsoft tenant — single-tenant operators got AADSTS50194 errors. New `tenant_id` setup field with `common` default; multi-tenant remains the default behavior. Three pinning tests in `test/phoenix_kit/integrations/oauth_test.exs`
  - Wired into `authorization_url/5`, `exchange_code/4`, `refresh_access_token/2`. URLs without `{` pass through unchanged (zero impact on Google / OpenRouter / Mistral / DeepSeek)
- "Resolve a LiveView module to its permission key" block-comment on `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth.permission_key_for_admin_view/1` documenting the four-step resolution order (static map → custom-tabs → `PhoenixKit.Modules.<X>.Web.*` namespace → registered-plugin namespace) and the fail-closed nil default

### Changed
- DB module extracted from core into the standalone `phoenix_kit_db` Hex package (PR #518)
  - Removed `lib/modules/db/` (`db.ex`, `listener.ex`, `web/{activity,index,show}.{ex,html.heex}`) — ~2010 lines across 8 files
  - `module_registry.ex` — dropped `PhoenixKit.Modules.DB` from `internal_modules/0`
  - `integration.ex` — dropped the three hand-registered `live "/admin/db…"` declarations (auto-discovery via `admin_tabs/0` picks them up once the package is installed)
  - `modules.html.heex` — dropped the hardcoded DB module card; auto-render via `<.module_card>` based on `admin_tabs/0` discovery
  - `dev_docs/guides/2026-02-24-module-system-guide.md` — moved `lib/modules/db/db.ex` from the Internal examples section to External as `phoenix_kit_db/`, between hello_world and document_creator
- `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry.not_installed_packages/0` switches from `Code.ensure_loaded?(pkg.module)` to OTP-app-name MapSet membership (PR #523) — the more correct semantics, since module-loading state and OTP-app-installed state aren't the same: an extracted-but-not-yet-installed module fragment could pass `Code.ensure_loaded?` but isn't actually a dep
- `PhoenixKit.Integrations.OAuth.verify_oauth_state/2` missing-state branch tightened from lenient `:ok` to `{:error, :state_mismatch}` (PR #516, closes a CSRF-relevant gap from PR #511's review NIT #10) — every `connect_oauth` event saves state via `save_oauth_state/2` before redirect post-2026-05, so a missing state at callback time means either bypass or row-mutated-mid-flow; both are CSRF-relevant
- `IntegrationPicker` drops the `conn.name == "default"` substitution that contradicted PR #511's own moduledoc ("Names are pure user-chosen labels with no system semantics") — always renders the user-chosen name + provider badge (PR #516, closes PR #511 NIT #6)
- `<.file_upload>` `full_upload/1` variant entry-progress label reads `Uploading… {entry.progress}%` instead of the bare percentage — `entry.progress` is always client→server upload progress per Phoenix LV convention, so the wording is universally accurate (PR #516)
- `LanguageSwitcher` resolves the per-language URL once per iteration via inline `<% url = ... %>` and reuses it for `href` and `phx-value-url` — halves the per-render `resolve_url/3` cost and pins both call sites to the same URL (post-merge triage)
- `KnownPackages` moduledoc grew an "Operational signals" section enumerating the three log levels (`:warning` stale-served / no-cache / `:error` exceeded max stale age) and what each signals operationally (post-merge triage)

### Fixed
- Publishing routing-strategy collision: any host route shaped `/:locale/<literal>/...` declared after `phoenix_kit_routes()` was silently shadowed by publishing's `/:language/:group/*path` catch-all (PR #524)
  - `phoenix_kit_routes/0` now emits a publishing-specific dispatch shim when `PhoenixKitPublishing.RouterDispatch` is loaded — internal-prefix scope at `/<url_prefix>/__phoenix_kit_publishing_dispatch` with `/localized` and `/root` discriminator sub-scopes, plus a `def call/2` override that calls `RouterDispatch.maybe_rewrite/1` on every request and only rewrites publishing-bound URLs onto the internal prefix. Host routes get a fair shot at every URL
  - `restore_path/2` runs after route binding (via the new `:phoenix_kit_publishing_internal` pipeline) so canonical-URL generation reads the URL the client sent — without it, publishing's `default_language_no_prefix` redirect would spin on the internal prefix forever
  - Compile-time gated on `Code.ensure_loaded?(PhoenixKitPublishing.RouterDispatch)`; installs without publishing in the dep tree get `quote do end` (no-op AST). The `__mix_recompile__?/0` mechanism injected by `phoenix_kit_routes/0` forces a host-router recompile when publishing is added or removed from deps — handles the dep-cache staleness case
  - Browser-smoke verified across 8 URL classes: localized + canonical publishing posts, host's `/:locale/services/view/...` routes (was 404 pre-fix), admin redirects, plain home, genuine 404s. HTML body sweep confirmed zero leakage of the internal prefix in canonical / og / links / JS / headers
- Custom-role users with explicit plugin permissions (`entities`, `billing`, `ai`, …) were silently locked out of plugin admin pages because `infer_permission_key_from_module/1` only resolved the core `PhoenixKit.Modules.*` namespace. External plugins (`PhoenixKitEntities.*`, `PhoenixKitBilling.*`, …) returned `nil` from all three resolution paths, collapsing onto the "no permission" branch in `enforce_admin_view_permission/2` (PR #521)
  - New `[top | _rest] -> ModuleRegistry.get_module_key_for_namespace(top)` clause on `infer_permission_key_from_module/1`. Old `_ -> nil` fallback removed (unreachable post-`Module.split/1`). Owner / Admin behaviour and the fail-closed default for genuinely unknown views are preserved
  - Initial implementation used `[^top_namespace | _]` which matched any registered module whose `Module.split` *starts with* the segment; live repro on a parent app showed `get_module_key_for_namespace("PhoenixKit") => "db"` because `PhoenixKit.Modules.DB` happened to be the first registered module beginning with `"PhoenixKit"`. Tightened to `[^top_namespace]` (exact, single segment) and pinned with a regression test
  - `permission_key_for_admin_view/1` exposed as `@doc false def` (was `defp`) so 4 new unit tests in `test/phoenix_kit_web/users/auth_test.exs` can exercise the resolution layers without LiveView mounting machinery; 3 new tests in `test/phoenix_kit/module_registry_test.exs` pin `get_module_key_for_namespace/1` (uses `Module.create/3` with explicit top-level fixture names to avoid test-module auto-nesting)
- `PhoenixKitWeb.PagesHTML` removed (PR #518) — the module had no controller, no routes, no callers. The `embed_templates "pages_html/*"` directive plus `pages_html/show.html.heex` plus the `integration.ex` docstring described a markdown-page-rendering feature that was never wired up. Publishing module covers actual CMS-page rendering. `ast-grep --lang elixir --pattern 'PhoenixKitWeb.PagesHTML'` confirms zero structural references remain
- `MediaBrowser` chevron-button positioning: daisyUI's active-state CSS replaces `transform` with `scale(0.97)` on click, which would clobber a `-translate-y-1/2` on the button itself and make it jump down 50% of its height. Chevron positioning now sits on a wrapper `<div>`, not the button (PR #519)
- `media_browser.html.heex` modal-viewer leading comment referenced the now-removed `viewer={true}` attr; rewritten to describe the new default click behaviour (post-merge triage)
- Dead `defaults[String.to_atom(key)]` fallback in `OAuth.interpolate_url/3` — no provider in `Providers.providers/0` ships an atom-keyed `url_defaults`, so the path was unreachable. Removed; comment documents that provider authors must use string keys (post-merge triage)
- `KnownPackages.fetch_hex_page/3` recursion grew an explicit `@max_pages 20` cap so a malformed `Link` header pointing back to the same page can no longer loop forever; `ensure_table/0` rescue now carries an explanatory comment about the `:ets.whereis/1` → `:ets.new/2` race window (post-merge triage)
- `KnownPackages` test_helper.exs: the `System.cmd("psql", ...)` DB-existence check now `try/rescue ErlangError` so environments where `psql` isn't on PATH fall through to the connect-direct branch instead of crashing the test boot (PR #523)
- Pre-existing credo `Refactor.Apply` opportunities on the three `apply/3` calls in `compile_publishing_routing/1` silenced with inline `# credo:disable-for-next-line` annotations and an empirically-verified comment explaining why the variable-indirection alternative (`mod = ModuleName; mod.fun()`) doesn't shield the compiler's static-resolution warning either. `mix credo --strict` now reports zero issues across the tree (post-merge triage)

### Removed
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.DB` and the entire `lib/modules/db/` directory — extracted to the standalone `phoenix_kit_db` Hex package; companion repo TBA (PR #518)
- `PhoenixKitWeb.PagesHTML` and its `pages_html/show.html.heex` template — dead code, never wired up to a controller or route (PR #518)
- `MediaBrowser`'s `:viewer` attr — the four-mode click handler collapsed to three modes (`select_mode` → `admin` → modal viewer); pickers reach `select_mode` via the toolbar's Select button. The default click action is now the modal viewer, so callers that previously passed `viewer={true}` see no behaviour change. Callers that depended on the old picker-by-default (no `admin`, no `viewer` → click toggles selection) need to instruct users to click the toolbar's Select button instead (PR #519)

## 1.7.105 - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `PhoenixKit.Migration.ensure_current/2` — re-runnable analog of `mix ecto.migrate` for test helpers and any boot path running against a long-lived database (PR #515)
  - Passes a fresh wall-clock version (`:os.system_time(:microsecond)`) to `Ecto.Migrator.up/4` on every call so Ecto sees a "new" migration each time and invokes the inner runner; PhoenixKit's own marker (the comment on the `phoenix_kit` table) short-circuits internally if there's nothing new to apply
  - Forwards `:prefix` from the Ecto.Migration runner context inside the new private `PhoenixKit.Migration.Runner` wrapper so callers passing `prefix: "auth"` aren't silently routed to `"public"`
  - Microsecond precision keeps the collision and clock-skew windows small enough that an NTP correction would have to rewind the clock by µs at exactly the wrong moment to hide a newly-shipped migration; bigint-safe (Postgres covers ~292 years)
  - The `schema_migrations` table accumulates one row per call — cosmetic noise acceptable for the test-DB use case; production migrations via `mix ecto.migrate` / `mix phoenix_kit.update` remain unchanged
- V110 migration: nullable `language VARCHAR(10)` column on `phoenix_kit_doc_templates` so each Document Creator template can be tagged with a single locale (PR #515)
  - Full locale codes (`en-US`, `et-EE`, `ja`) — matches `PhoenixKit.Module.Languages.get_enabled_languages/0` output; lossless, consumers that want bare base codes can derive them via `DialectMapper.dialect_to_base/1`
  - Existing rows survive without a backfill; the form (landing in `phoenix_kit_document_creator` separately) pre-selects the project's primary language when creating new templates
  - Documents intentionally do not get a language column — they inherit from `template_uuid → templates.language`
  - `@current_version` 109 → 110; ⚡ LATEST tag moved off V109 onto V110
- `PhoenixKit.Migration.Runner.runner_opts/1` — pure transform of the runner-context prefix into opts threaded to `PhoenixKit.Migration.up/1` / `down/1` (PR #515 review follow-up)
  - Split out of the previous closure-style `runner_opts/0` so the prefix-forwarding behaviour can be regression-tested without spinning up a real `Ecto.Migration.Runner` process (which conflicts with the Ecto sandbox)
  - Three new unit assertions in `test/phoenix_kit/migration_test.exs` pin the contract: `nil → []` (drop, so `with_defaults/2`'s `"public"` default isn't clobbered), `"auth" → [prefix: "auth"]`, arbitrary tenant prefix forwarded verbatim. If someone "simplifies" `runner_opts` to always return `[]`, CI now fails
- "Return contract" section in the `ensure_current/2` moduledoc clarifying that failures (advisory-lock contention, migration crashes, connection errors) raise from `Ecto.Migrator.up/4` rather than being wrapped in `{:error, _}` (PR #515 review follow-up)

### Changed
- `test/test_helper.exs` switched from path-form `Ecto.Migrator.run(repo, migrations_path, :up, all: true)` to `PhoenixKit.Migration.ensure_current/2` (PR #515)
  - Deletes the now-redundant wrapper migration `test/support/postgres/migrations/20260316000000_add_phoenix_kit.exs`
- `AGENTS.md` test-infra section updated: `test_helper.exs` is now the canonical migration application point, with a **Do not** warning against the stale tuple form `Ecto.Migrator.run(repo, [{0, PhoenixKit.Migration}], :up, all: true)` (PR #515)

### Fixed
- Documented test-helper migration patterns silently went stale after the first run (PR #515)
  - Both the tuple form (`Ecto.Migrator.run(repo, [{0, PhoenixKit.Migration}], :up, all: true)`, documented in `dev_docs/migration_cleanup.md`) and the path form (used by core's own test_helper via the `20260316000000_add_phoenix_kit.exs` wrapper) hit the same trap: Ecto.Migrator records the version in `schema_migrations` after the first call and filters that entry out of pending on every subsequent boot. `PhoenixKit.Migration.up/1` was never re-invoked, so newly-shipped Vxxx migrations didn't apply on subsequent boots even though PhoenixKit's own marker was idempotent. Symptom: `column ... does not exist` after `mix deps.update phoenix_kit` brought in new migrations but the test DB stayed at the old marker
  - Verified empirically — core's own `phoenix_kit_test` was at marker 107 even though Hex 1.7.103 shipped V108 + V109; first boot after switching to `ensure_current/2` advanced the marker through V108 / V109 / V110 correctly

## 1.7.104 - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- Customer Service module extracted from core into the standalone `phoenix_kit_customer_support` Hex package — companion repo: [BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_customer_support](https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_customer_support) (PR #514)
  - Removed `lib/modules/customer_service/` (~6 KLOC, 22 files) and `lib/phoenix_kit_web/routes/customer_service.ex`; the module is now an external optional dependency
  - `module_registry.ex` — dropped `PhoenixKit.Modules.CustomerService` from `internal_modules/0`, added the corresponding `phoenix_kit_customer_support` entry to `known_external_packages/0`
  - `integration.ex` — replaced inline `/dashboard/customer-service/tickets` route blocks with `Code.ensure_loaded?(PhoenixKitCustomerSupport.Web.UserList)` guards so absent-package = no routes
  - DB tables (`phoenix_kit_tickets`, `phoenix_kit_ticket_*`) stay in core under their existing names — they're domain-shaped, not module-shaped, and the prior migrations (V35/V51/V53/V58/V72/V74/V75/V77) remain in core's migration history
- Renamed "Customer Service" → "Customer Support" across the public surface (PR #514)
  - Module: `PhoenixKitCustomerService` → `PhoenixKitCustomerSupport`
  - OTP app: `:phoenix_kit_customer_service` → `:phoenix_kit_customer_support`
  - Hex package: `phoenix_kit_customer_service` → `phoenix_kit_customer_support`
  - Settings keys: `customer_service_*` → `customer_support_*` (7 keys)
  - URL paths: `/customer-service/*` → `/customer-support/*` (admin + user-facing, both base and locale-prefixed routes)
  - Permission key: `customer_service` → `customer_support`
  - Dashboard module card and admin nav target updated to match

### Added
- V109 migration: rename Customer Service module identifiers in-place so existing installs migrate cleanly (PR #514)
  - Renames 7 settings keys from `customer_service_*` → `customer_support_*` in `phoenix_kit_settings`
  - Renames `auto_granted_perm:customer_service` → `auto_granted_perm:customer_support`
  - Renames `phoenix_kit_role_permissions.module_key` from `customer_service` → `customer_support`
  - Idempotent (`IF EXISTS` guards on every rename); reversible `down/1` for emergency rollback
  - `@current_version` 108 → 109; ⚡ LATEST tag moved off V107 onto V109

### Fixed
- `PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.anonymize_user_tickets/1` was a no-op since the original Tickets → CustomerService rename — `Module.concat([PhoenixKit, Modules, Tickets, Ticket])` resolved to a never-loaded module so the `Code.ensure_loaded?` guard always failed and ticket anonymization silently skipped on user deletion. Now points at `PhoenixKitCustomerSupport.Ticket` (PR #514)
- V108 (drag-and-drop position columns, shipped in 1.7.103) was missing from the `lib/phoenix_kit/migrations/postgres.ex` per-version docstring catalog. Backfilled in this release alongside the V109 entry (PR #514 review)
- `lib/phoenix_kit/migrations/postgres/v109.ex` `rename_role_permission/4` carried an unused `_prefix` arg — the table name is already prefix-qualified at the call site. Trimmed to `/3` (PR #514 review)

## 1.7.103 - 2026-05-02

### Added
- V107 migration: pin AI endpoints to a specific integration row via `integration_uuid` + add the missing unique index on `lower(name)` (PR #511)
  - Nullable `integration_uuid uuid` column on `phoenix_kit_ai_endpoints` with btree index
  - Backfill maps existing `provider` strings to integration rows: exact `"provider:name"` matches get the corresponding storage row; bare `"provider"` gets the most-recently-validated `integration:provider:*` row, tiebreaking on `uuid ASC` (UUIDv7 time-ordered). Unresolvable endpoints stay NULL
  - Unique index `phoenix_kit_ai_endpoints_name_index ON (lower(name))` — the `unique_constraint(:name)` declaration in the changeset has been dead code since V34 created this table without the index
- V108 migration: `position integer DEFAULT 0` on three admin list surfaces — `phoenix_kit_entities`, `phoenix_kit_cat_catalogues`, `phoenix_kit_cat_items` — so drag-and-drop reordering can persist user-driven order (PR #512)
- Strict-UUID Integrations public API (PR #511)
  - Write-side APIs now take only the integration row's uuid — no more deriving storage keys from JSONB fields
  - `Integrations.resolve_to_uuid/1` — dual-input lookup primitive that accepts a uuid or a `provider:name` string (for `migrate_legacy/0` callbacks)
  - `migrate_legacy/0` optional callback on `PhoenixKit.Module` — each module owns its legacy data shape; core provides primitives. Orchestrated by `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry.run_all_legacy_migrations/0`
  - Mistral, DeepSeek, and Microsoft 365 added to the built-in providers registry
  - `integration_picker` updated: no auto-select on single-provider, toggle-to-deselect support
- Drag-and-drop core infrastructure (PR #512)
  - `<.draggable_list>` new `:draggable` boolean attr (default `true`) — when false, renders without SortableJS hook and grab-cursor styling
  - `<.table_default>` new `:on_reorder`, `:reorder_scope`, `:reorder_group`, `:item_id` attrs — wire the card-view container as a SortableGrid hook target for cross-container drag
  - `SortableGrid` hook (JS): `data-sortable-group` for cross-container drag, `readScope/1` helper for `data-sortable-scope-*` attrs, cross-container `onEnd` detection with `from*` scope prefix, `try/catch` wrapping
  - `TableCardView` hook (JS): `updated()` callback re-applies saved view mode after LV re-renders so card/table toggle survives SortableJS drops
- Media viewer modal on `MediaBrowser` (PR #513)
  - New `viewer={true}` attr — clicking a file opens an in-place modal with image/video/PDF/icon preview, metadata sidebar (filename, type, MIME, size, uploaded date), and Download button. Closes via X / Esc / backdrop
  - Prev/next chevrons and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight keyboard shortcuts step through the current page's files; arrows hide at boundaries
  - `PhoenixKitComments.Web.CommentsComponent` embedded in the sidebar when the Comments module is installed and enabled (optional-dep wiring: `@compile {:no_warn_undefined}` + `Code.ensure_loaded?` + `@dialyzer :nowarn_function`)
- Arity-2 `dynamic_children_fn` `@typedoc` + test-only delegate for the admin sidebar dispatcher (PR #506 follow-up in #512)

### Changed
- `handle_event("click_file", …)` in MediaBrowser refactored from two-mode `if/else` to four-clause `cond`: `select_mode` → `admin` → `viewer` → picker default (PR #513)
- `connected_at` semantics clarified in AGENTS.md — rewritten on every successful re-test (not one-shot); `last_validated_at` rewritten unconditionally on every validation attempt, success or failure
- Bumped `leaf` editor dependency `~> 0.2.10 → ~> 0.2.11` and the matching CDN URL (PR #513)

### Fixed
- AGENTS.md doc drift: `PhoenixKit.Modules.run_all_legacy_migrations/0` corrected to `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry.run_all_legacy_migrations/0`; V107 moduledoc tiebreak clarified as `uuid ASC` not `inserted_at ASC` (PR #511 review)
- V107 unique-name index verified with three new integration tests: index exists, duplicate names rejected, case-only differences collide (PR #511 review)
- Media viewer modal: `String.starts_with?/2` guarded with `is_binary(f.mime_type)` so nil mime_type falls through to the icon fallback instead of crashing (PR #513 review)
- Media viewer modal: PDF iframe hardened with `sandbox="allow-same-origin"` to block embedded JavaScript in same-origin deployments (PR #513 review)
- `<.draggable_list>` `data-id` now always emitted regardless of `:draggable` attr so click-to-select handlers and test selectors work in both modes (PR #512 review)
- `:reorder_scope` attr doc on `<.table_default>` now documents the camelCase round-trip (`:category_uuid` → `"categoryUuid"` in the LV handler payload) (PR #512 review)

## 1.7.102 - 2026-04-29

### Added
- V105 migration: CRM tables for the upcoming `phoenix_kit_crm` plugin (PR #507)
  - `phoenix_kit_crm_role_settings` — one row per role with `enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` so existing roles stay opted out until explicitly enabled. PK on `role_uuid`; FK → `phoenix_kit_user_roles(uuid)` ON DELETE CASCADE
  - `phoenix_kit_crm_user_role_view` — per-user, per-scope view preferences (column selection, ordering, filters). UUIDv7 PK; unique `(user_uuid, scope)`; index on `(user_uuid)`; FK → `phoenix_kit_users(uuid)` ON DELETE CASCADE. `scope` is a string like `"role:<uuid>"` or `"companies"`
- V106 migration: split `phoenix_kit_projects.name` uniqueness across templates and real projects (PR #510)
  - Replaces V101's single global unique index on `lower(name)` with two partial unique indexes: `phoenix_kit_projects_name_template_index WHERE is_template = true` and `phoenix_kit_projects_name_project_index WHERE is_template = false`
  - Lets a template `"Onboarding"` and a real project `"Onboarding"` coexist, unblocking `Projects.create_project_from_template/2` for the common reuse-the-template-name path
  - `down/1` recreates V101's single global index; lossy if a template and a real project share a name post-V106 — resolve duplicates before rolling back
- Legal module i18n — translations across `de/fr/it/pl` plus refreshed `ru/es`. New `de/fr/it/pl` POs created via `mix gettext.merge --locale` with proper `Plural-Forms` headers (German `n != 1`, French `n > 1`, Italian `n != 1`, Polish 3-form rule). Pre-existing non-empty `msgstr` values preserved (PR #509)
- `lib/phoenix_kit_web/legal_gettext_manifest.ex` — re-emits the 50 translatable strings used by `phoenix_kit_legal` so the gettext extractor (which doesn't walk into deps) records them into core's POT. Never called at runtime; pure extraction target with refresh procedure documented in the moduledoc (PR #509)
- `css_sources/0` accepts string entries — `@callback css_sources()` widened from `[atom()]` to `[atom() | String.t()]`. Strings flow through `format_source/2` → `source_for_path/1` (absolute paths emit `@source "<abs>";` verbatim, relative get the standard `../../` prefix); atoms continue to resolve via parent app's mix.exs deps. Lets modules mix OTP-app atoms with literal path strings — first known consumer is `phoenix_kit_legal`, which ships a path-dep absolute fallback alongside its OTP-app entry so both Hex and path-dep installs work without parent-app toggles. Backwards compatible: existing `def css_sources, do: [:phoenix_kit_my_module]` keeps working unchanged (PR #509)

### Changed
- Bumped `leaf` editor dependency `~> 0.2.6 → ~> 0.2.10` and the matching CDN URL in `priv/static/assets/phoenix_kit.js` so the runtime loader pulls the same version. Includes `min-width: 0` + toolbar-wrap fixes so the editor stops claiming an unbounded intrinsic width on mount (PR #508)
- `priv/gettext/default.pot` cleanup — dropped ~900 phantom msgids left over from modules extracted to standalone packages (billing, publishing, entities, etc.) (PR #509)

### Fixed
- `application/pdf` uploads in MediaBrowser. `determine_file_type/1` returned `"pdf"`, but the `File` changeset validates `file_type` against `["image", "video", "audio", "document", "archive", "other"]` — every PDF upload silently failed validation and never reached any bucket. Now maps `application/pdf` → `"document"`, matching how form-upload integrations already classify PDFs (PR #507)
- V106 `COMMENT ON TABLE` version values were off by one (`up` wrote `'105'` instead of `'106'`, `down` wrote `'104'` instead of `'105'`). The migration framework reads this comment as the source of truth for the migrated version, so on the incremental V105 → V106 upgrade path the comment never advanced past `'105'` — V106.up would replay on every deploy and the admin dashboard / `mix phoenix_kit.status` would report a stale version. Fresh installs masked the bug because `handle_version_recording/4` stamps the final version on multi-step runs and overrode V106's bad write. Caught in review of PR #510 and amended in place since V106 had not yet shipped to Hex

## 1.7.101 - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Notifications module** — per-user inbox driven by the activity log. When `PhoenixKit.Activity.log/1` records an entry with `target_uuid != actor_uuid`, a row is inserted into `phoenix_kit_notifications` for the target user. Independent `seen_at` / `dismissed_at` per row, per-user PubSub topic (`"phoenix_kit:notifications:<user_uuid>"`), global kill-switch via `notifications_enabled` setting (default `"true"`). Admins still audit via `/admin/activity` and don't receive notifications (PR #505)
  - V104 migration: `phoenix_kit_notifications` with UUIDv7 PK, FKs to `phoenix_kit_activities` and `phoenix_kit_users` (both `ON DELETE CASCADE`), unique `(activity_uuid, recipient_uuid)` index, partial `(recipient_uuid, inserted_at DESC) WHERE dismissed_at IS NULL` index for the inbox read path
  - `PhoenixKit.Notifications` public API: `maybe_create_from_activity/1`, `list_for_user/2`, `recent_for_user/2`, `count_unread/1`, `mark_seen/2`, `mark_all_seen/1`, `dismiss/2`, `dismiss_all/1`, `get_notification/2`, `enabled?/0`, `retention_days/0`, `prune/1`
  - `PhoenixKit.Notifications.Render.render/1` — maps action → `%{icon, text, link, actor_uuid}`; honors metadata overrides (`notification_text`, `notification_icon`, `notification_link`) before falling back to the action lookup
  - `PhoenixKit.Notifications.Types` registry — three core types (`account`, `posts`, `comments`) plus extension point for external modules via the new optional `notification_types/0` callback on `PhoenixKit.Module`
  - `PhoenixKit.Notifications.Prefs` — per-user preferences persisted in `custom_fields.notification_preferences` (reuses V18 JSONB column; no migration). Fail-open on any ambiguity
  - `PhoenixKit.Notifications.PruneWorker` — daily Oban cron at `"0 4 * * *"`; retention via `notifications_retention_days` (falls back to `activity_retention_days`, default 90)
  - `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.NotificationsBell` — sticky nested LiveView for the bell + dropdown. Not mounted by default; parent apps render it where they have a user-facing header via `Phoenix.Component.live_render(..., sticky: true, session: %{"user_uuid" => ...})`. Badge + recent list refresh live via PubSub
  - Notification preferences section in `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Components.UserSettings` — one toggle per registered type; unknown submitted keys dropped at the call site
  - `notifications_enabled` toggle on `/admin/settings`
- Arity-2 `dynamic_children_fn` for admin sidebar tabs — callbacks can now be `(scope, locale -> [tab])` in addition to the existing `(scope -> [tab])`. Backwards-compatible extension: the sidebar dispatches on arity, every existing 1-arity callback keeps working unchanged. Lets plugins render locale-aware child labels without reading `Gettext.get_locale/1` at render time (PR #506)

## 1.7.100 - 2026-04-22

### Added
- V103 migration: nullable self-FK `parent_uuid` on `phoenix_kit_cat_categories` with b-tree index on `(parent_uuid)` for arbitrary-depth category trees. Existing rows stay `NULL` and become roots — no backfill. No DB-level `ON DELETE` cascade (subtree cascades are owned by the context layer so they go through soft-delete + activity log) (PR #503)
- `scope_folder_id` attr on `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Components.MediaSelectorModal` — filters the browse query to the given folder plus any files reached via `FolderLink`, and assigns newly-uploaded files into that folder (adopt as home if orphan, else add a `FolderLink`). Plugins scoping the picker to a single domain object (e.g. a catalogue item) pass this after lazy-creating their folder (PR #503)
- `PhoenixKit.Settings.Setting.optional_settings/0` accessor exposing `@optional_settings` for invariant tests
- Invariant test (`test/phoenix_kit/settings/setting_test.exs`) asserting every empty-string default in `PhoenixKit.Settings.get_defaults/0` is also in `@optional_settings`, to prevent the class of bug fixed in PR #502 from recurring

### Changed
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.File` changeset `file_type` allowlist widened from `["image", "video", "document", "archive"]` to include `"audio"` and `"other"` so non-image/video uploads bucket cleanly (PR #503)
- `MediaSelectorModal.load_files/2` refactored into four composable `scope_files_by_{user,folder,type,search}` helpers — credo cyclomatic-complexity fix from adding the new scope branch (PR #503)

### Fixed
- Settings batch save no longer rolls back when `site_icon_file_uuid` or `default_tab_title` is left empty on the General Settings form. Both keys added to `@optional_settings` in `PhoenixKit.Settings.Setting` and seeded with empty-string defaults in `PhoenixKit.Settings.get_defaults/0` (PR #502)
- `MediaSelectorModal.maybe_set_folder/2` errors (from the `folder_uuid` update or `FolderLink` insert) now log a warning via `warn_on_folder_error/3` instead of being silently discarded by `_ =`. Previously, a failed scope assignment after a successful upload left no trace

## 1.7.99 - 2026-04-20

### Added
- V100 migration: staff tables — `phoenix_kit_staff_departments`, `phoenix_kit_staff_teams`, `phoenix_kit_staff_people`, `phoenix_kit_staff_team_memberships` (PR #498)
- V101 migration: projects tables — `phoenix_kit_project_tasks`, `phoenix_kit_project_task_dependencies`, `phoenix_kit_projects`, `phoenix_kit_project_assignments`, `phoenix_kit_project_dependencies`; polymorphic assignee with `CHECK (num_nonnulls(...) <= 1)` (PR #498)
- V102 migration: smart catalogues + per-catalogue/item discount (PR #500)
  - `phoenix_kit_cat_catalogues.discount_percentage` (NOT NULL DEFAULT 0) and `kind` (`'standard' | 'smart'`) columns with CHECK constraints
  - `phoenix_kit_cat_items.discount_percentage`, `default_value`, `default_unit` override columns
  - new `phoenix_kit_cat_item_catalogue_rules` table with unique `(item_uuid, referenced_catalogue_uuid)` and ON DELETE CASCADE on both FKs
  - partial index on `kind = 'smart'`
- `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.Embed` — one-line `use` macro that injects `on_mount` upload setup, the `"validate"` upload-channel stub, and the MediaBrowser `handle_info` delegator (PR #499)
- MediaBrowser selection menu with bulk download (staggered `<a download>` dispatch via `MediaDragDrop` hook) (PR #499)
- MediaBrowser `admin` attr to gate detail-page `push_navigate` — picker mode (default) vs admin mode (PR #499)
- MediaBrowser drag-drop file-to-folder move (PR #499)
- MediaBrowser toggleable search bar in the header (PR #499)
- MediaBrowser drag-drop upload at any folder level (PR #499)
- Site icon + default tab title settings, logo moved to main settings page (PR #499)
- MultilangForm debounce flow: `mount_multilang/1` attaches a hidden `:handle_info` hook via `Phoenix.LiveView.attach_hook/4`; `handle_switch_language/2` schedules a 150 ms trailing debounce via `Process.send_after` (timer ref stored in `socket.private` to avoid render+diff cycles); `switch_lang_js/2` toggles skeleton/fields `hidden` classes client-side at t=0 (PR #500)
- `<.input>` gains a `wrapper_class` attr for the outer `phx-feedback-for` div (PR #500)
- `test_load_filters` / `test_ignore_filters` in `mix.exs` for Elixir 1.19 `mix test` hygiene (PR #500)
- AGENTS.md: Core Form Components section, Multilang Form Components section, and CHANGELOG-ownership rule (entries written by the maintainer, not agents)

### Changed
- MediaBrowser sidebar and content unified into a single card (PR #499)
- Scope-root new-folder form aligned with sibling folder rows (PR #499)
- Core form components (`<.input>`, `<.select>`, `<.textarea>`, `<.checkbox>`) now merge the `class` attr onto the styled element itself — matches the Phoenix 1.7 generator convention. No in-tree caller used the old wrapper-class behavior; external consumers should switch to `wrapper_class` on `<.input>` (PR #500)
- `compile.phoenix_kit_css_sources` emits absolute dep paths verbatim instead of prefixing `../../` (PR #500)

### Fixed
- MediaBrowser list view broken by stale view-toggle CSS (PR #499)
- Credo `AliasUsage` warning inside `MediaBrowser.Embed`'s quoted block silenced (PR #499)

## 1.7.98 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- V99 migration: `trashed_at` column on `phoenix_kit_files` with partial index for soft-delete (PR #497)
- Media trash bucket: soft-delete files with restore/empty/permanent-delete actions and sidebar count badge
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Workers.PruneTrashJob` — daily Oban cron (3 AM) that permanently deletes files older than `trash_retention_days` (default 30)
- Drag-drop upload: drop device files directly onto the folder content area (`FolderDropUpload` JS hook)
- URL-param hydration on first mount so reloads don't flash the root view

### Fixed
- Scope guard on `restore_selected` in MediaBrowser — a scoped embed could previously restore files outside its scope via a crafted `toggle_select` payload
- Trash view, permanent-delete, and `empty_trash` now respect `scope_folder_id` via recursive CTE
- `list_files/1` excludes trashed files
- Breadcrumb and search bar moved inside card body so padding matches grid/list content

## 1.7.97 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- V97 migration: per-item `markup_percentage` override on catalogue items (PR #493)
- V98 migration: `alternative_formats` column on storage dimensions
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Shared.Components.ImageSet` — responsive `<picture>` component with AVIF/WebP/JPEG `<source>` entries
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.VariantNaming` — format-suffix parsing utility
- Multi-format variant generation (WebP/AVIF alongside primary format per dimension)
- Variant dimensions and file sizes shown on media detail page
- UUID search support on media page search bar

### Changed
- V95 migration made truly idempotent for `folder_uuid` column (raw SQL `IF NOT EXISTS` block)
- Dimensions table format cell renders as `JPEG + WEBP, AVIF` (fixed stray `" +"` separator)

### Fixed
- Long text overflow in media detail sidebar
- Missing original file size in variant download buttons

## 1.7.96 - 2026-04-13

## 1.7.78 - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Add dynamic timeout scaling for translation worker (~1.5 min per language, minimum 15 minutes)
- Add structured logging with consistent prefixes (`[Sync.Notifier]`, `[Sync.API]`, `[Sync.Connections]`) throughout Sync connection flow

- Fix Sync crash on non-UTF8 binary data — base64-encode raw binaries during serialization, decode on import
- Fix Sync pull error responses silently ignored — add `Logger.error` to all failure paths (401, 404, HTTP errors, offline, invalid response)
- Fix Sync completion UI not showing skipped/errored records — track and display per-table import counts with warning state

## 1.7.77 - 2026-03-17

- Add automated scheduled jobs cleanup to prevent table bloat (deletes completed jobs older than 7 days)
- Add `lastmod` (last modified) to sitemap entries for SEO — router-discovered routes use beam file mtime, static entries use current date

### Changed
- Replace inline markdown CSS with centralized prose overrides in `app.css` using `@layer base` (removes 323 lines of duplication)
- Update publishing preview template to show full public interface with working language switcher

- Fix translation reload showing primary language content instead of translated content
- Fix PubSub subscription mismatch for translation and version events on timestamp-mode posts (slug vs uuid topic mismatch)

- Fix whitespace in slug format examples on publishing group pages

## 1.7.76 - 2026-03-16

## 1.7.32 - 2026-02-03
- Storage Module: Smart file serving with bucket access types (V50 migration)
  - Add `access_type` field to buckets: "public", "private", "signed"
  - Local files are now served directly without temp file copying (performance improvement)
  - Public cloud buckets redirect to CDN URL (faster, reduces server load)
  - Private cloud buckets proxy files through server (for ACL-protected storage)
  - Add retry logic for bucket cache race conditions during file access

  **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Cloud Bucket Access Type**

  Cloud buckets (S3, B2, R2) now default to `access_type = "public"`, which redirects
  users directly to the bucket's public URL instead of proxying through the server.

  **If you have private/ACL-protected buckets:**
  - Go to Storage → Buckets → Edit your bucket
  - Set "Access Type" to "Private"
  - Files will be proxied through the server using credentials (previous behavior)

  **If you have public buckets (redirect mode):**

  For redirect to work, your bucket must be publicly accessible:

  1. **Enable Public Access** in your cloud provider settings:
     - AWS S3: Disable "Block all public access" and set bucket policy
     - Backblaze B2: Set bucket to "Public"
     - Cloudflare R2: Configure public access or use Custom Domain

  2. **Configure CORS** if serving files cross-origin (required when your site
     domain differs from bucket domain):

     AWS S3 / R2 CORS configuration example:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
         "AllowedOrigins": ["https://yourdomain.com"],
         "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "Content-Length"],
         "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
       }
     ]
     ```

     Replace `https://yourdomain.com` with your actual domain, or use `"*"` for
     any origin (less secure but simpler for testing).

  See AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enabling-cors-examples.html
