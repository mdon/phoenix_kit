# Plans

Implementation plans and refactor summaries. These documents were created **before or during** a significant change to guide the work. Most are fully executed — the code has been changed and the plan is now historical context explaining why things are the way they are.

## When to Add a File Here

- Step-by-step plan for a multi-PR refactor or migration
- Refactor summary documenting what changed and the impact
- Design decisions made before implementation began
