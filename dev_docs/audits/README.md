# Audits & Reports

Point-in-time analysis documents. Each captures a snapshot of the codebase at a specific date — what was found, what was inconsistent, what needed fixing. These are **historical records**, not living documents. They don't get updated as the codebase evolves.

## When to Add a File Here

- Audit of a specific pattern across the codebase (e.g. "how many places use X wrong")
- Analysis report produced before or during a refactor
- Performance or compilation investigation
- PR quality assessment
