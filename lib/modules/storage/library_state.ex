defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.LibraryState do
  @moduledoc """
  What is going on with each library's storage, derived — never stored — from two
  things: how many of its files are out of date
  (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Reconciler.counts_by_library/0`, one grouped query)
  and its `storage.reconcile` run
  (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Jobs.Reconcile`, `dev_docs/plans/2026-10-03-job-runs.md`
  §6.3, R8).

  | state | when |
  |---|---|
  | `:paused` | its reconcile run is paused (or pausing) |
  | `:syncing` | a reconcile run is queued or running — "N files left" |
  | `:attention` | no run is active, and either its last run failed with files left, or the reconciler tried files and could not finish them (they wait out their retry window) |
  | `:waiting` | files are out of date and **no run** is active: the queue is down, or nothing has triggered yet — the case a global count hides |
  | `:up_to_date` | nothing is out of date |

  "Up to date" means the files carry the revisions of their library's profile and
  variant set. It does **not** prove every recorded object is still on its bucket;
  that is what a later `storage.verify` is for (§6.4).

  The map returned for a library:

      %{state: :syncing, out_of_date: 12, eligible: 12, failing: 0, run: %Run{}}

  `run` is the active run when there is one, else the last one, else `nil`.
