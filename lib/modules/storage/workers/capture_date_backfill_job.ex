defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Workers.CaptureDateBackfillJob do
  @moduledoc """
  Dates the images and videos stored before capture dates existed (V200).

  New uploads get their date from `ProcessFileJob`. Files already stored have
  none, so this job walks them in `@batch_size` batches, in uuid order, reads
  each one's bytes and records a date through the same
  `CaptureDate.replace?/2` guard. Every visited file ends up with a date: when
  its bytes cannot be read, the file name or the upload time is used.

  **Chaining.** Each run handles one batch and enqueues the next with a
  cursor (`"after"`, the last uuid it visited), so a file is visited once per
  pass even when it cannot be dated — a stuck row cannot loop the chain. Only
  one pending run exists at a time (`unique` over `[:worker, :queue]`,
  ignoring the cursor); a run that is executing does not count, so it can
  enqueue its own successor.

  **An edited image** is dated from its unedited backup
  (`original_file_uuid`) when it has one: an edit keeps only the ICC profile,
  so the edited bytes carry no EXIF.

  Start a pass in the background with `enqueue/0`, or run one to completion
  in the calling process with `run_pass/1` — which is what
  `mix phoenix_kit.storage.backfill_capture_dates` does.
