defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Reconciler do
  @moduledoc """
  Makes each file match its library's storage profile and variant set
  (V205, plan §6.3). `Storage.Workers.ReconcileJob` runs it.

  A file records the profile and the variant set (each at a revision) it
  was last placed by (`placed_profile_uuid` / `placed_revision`,
  `placed_variant_set_uuid` / `placed_variant_revision`; NULL is the
  Default at revision 1). It is **stale** (`stale_query/0`) when either
  differs from what its library uses now: the library moved to another
  profile or set, one of them changed, or an upload made fewer copies or
  sizes than wanted (which stamps revision 0).

  For a stale file, `reconcile_file/1`:

    * **locations** (G4, G5, G6) — for each completed instance: an original
      upload is an `:original`, everything else (sizes, tiles, renders) is
      `:derived` (G13; an edit's hidden backup of the unedited original is
      an original). Its good copies are on the profile's buckets that store
      that kind and are `active` or `read_only`. While there are fewer than
      the profile wants (capped at the buckets it can use), the object is
      copied to more of its writable buckets and each copy is checked
      before it counts. Once enough are good, copies on buckets the profile
      no longer uses for it (not listed, `draining`, storing the other
      kind) are unlinked: the location row goes, and the object on that
      bucket only when nothing else there names the key (G11,
      `Storage.unlink_location/2`).
    * **variants** (G15, G16) — sizes of the set the file lacks are made,
      those whose `spec_hash` differs from the size's spec now are made
      again, and those the set no longer has (a size deleted from it; a
      disabled size is kept) are deleted.

  A file that ends up matching both is stamped with what it now matches,
  at the revisions read when it was started (a change made meanwhile leaves
  it stale for the next pass). A failure leaves it stale; the next pass
  tries again. Instances not yet checked by the location backfill are
  skipped (their buckets are not known), and so is a file still uploading
  or with an image edit pending.
