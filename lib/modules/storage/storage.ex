defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage do
  @moduledoc """
  Storage context for managing files, buckets, and dimensions.

  Provides a distributed file storage system with support for multiple storage providers
  (local filesystem, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2) with automatic redundancy
  and failover capabilities.

  ## Features

  - Multi-location storage with configurable redundancy (1-5 copies)
  - Support for local, S3, B2, and R2 storage providers
  - Automatic variant generation for images and videos
  - Priority-based storage selection
  - Built-in usage tracking and statistics
  - PostgreSQL-backed file registry

  ## Folder conventions for modules

  Modules that keep one folder per record (catalogue items, warehouse
  documents, CRM records, machines, …) build on
  `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.ResourceFolders`, which holds the convention:
  the `:attachments_parent_folder` / `:attachments_folder_name` host hooks
  (`fun(kind, actor_uuid, subject)`, with the `fun/2` fallback), the lookup
  order (stored pointer → host name under the parent → deterministic
  `<module>-<kind>-<uuid>` name under the parent, at the root, anywhere),
  race-safe find-or-create, and attaching, listing and detaching files.
  Moving or renaming existing folders stays with the host (adoption is a
  host concern), and nothing creates folders for people's own use.

  Hosts typically group containers (`Warehouse/Supplier orders`, `CRM/Contacts`)
  and may re-parent a container that was created elsewhere; `update_folder/3`
  with `parent_uuid` moves a folder (with cycle check), and the
  `(name, parent_uuid)` unique index means the same name can exist under
  different parents.

  ## Protecting host-owned files

  Orphan detection (`find_orphaned_files/1`, `count_orphaned_files/1`,
  `file_orphaned?/1`, and the `mix phoenix_kit.cleanup_orphaned_files` /
  `DeleteOrphanedFileJob` pipeline built on them) only knows about the
  references core itself ships with. A host whose own tables point at
  files — an order, a project, any record with an image or attachment
  column — is one cleanup run away from losing them unless it registers
  itself through one of two hooks:

  - `config :phoenix_kit, :protected_file_uuids, [...]` — a fixed list, a
    zero-arity function, or an `{module, function, args}` MFA returning the
    uuids that must never be treated as orphans. Simple, but the host has
    to enumerate every referenced uuid on every query.
  - `config :phoenix_kit, :file_reference_sources, [...]` — a list of
    `{module, function}` / `{module, function, args}` entries, each
    returning a list of `Ecto.Query.dynamic/2` expressions over the file
    binding `f`. Every expression is ANDed onto the orphan query's
    `where` verbatim, so **each one must itself be the negative test** —
    a `NOT EXISTS (...)` fragment, the same shape core's own catalogue
    and shop checks use (see the example below). Core does not wrap or
    negate anything: a positively-phrased `EXISTS (...)` expression
    inverts the meaning and marks exactly the referenced files as the
    orphans.
    A plain `{table, column}` tuple is shorthand for a native column
    reference, and `{table, :jsonb_key, key}` for a `data->>'key'` pointer.
    A source that cannot be built — its table does not exist, its function
    raises, the entry is malformed — **fails closed**: a `Logger.error/1`
    names it and no file is treated as orphaned until it is fixed. Skipping
    it would drop that source's guard and hand cleanup every file only the
    host references.

  Example:

      config :phoenix_kit, :file_reference_sources, [
        {MyApp.Media, :file_reference_sources}
      ]

      def file_reference_sources do
        [
          dynamic(
            [f],
            fragment(
              "NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM my_app_orders o WHERE o.data->>'featured_image_uuid' = ?::text)",
              f.uuid
            )
          )
        ]
      end

  ## Module Status

  This module is **always enabled** and cannot be disabled. It provides core
  functionality for file management across PhoenixKit.

  What a downloaded copy of `file` should be called, for `variant`.

  Every variant of a picture used to answer with the uploader's own
  filename, so a browser saving three of them ended up with `photo.jpg`,
  `photo (1).jpg`, `photo (2).jpg` — three files whose only difference was
  a number the desktop assigned, and nothing to say which was which.

  The name says which copy it is: `photo-large.jpg`, `photo-original.jpg`,
  and for the copies with the annotations drawn in,
  `photo-large-annotated.jpg`. `ext` comes from the stored instance rather
  than from the URL — a signed URL ends in a token, and a burn is a JPEG
  even where the picture it was drawn on is a PNG.

  # ===== FILE EVENTS (PubSub) =====

  @doc """
  Subscribes the current process to file lifecycle events.

  Messages delivered:

    * `{:phoenix_kit_file_processed, file_uuid}` — background processing
      finished for the file (dimensions extracted, variants generated —
      or processing failed; reload the row to see which). Broadcast by
      `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.ProcessFileJob` so open UIs can refresh
      a just-uploaded file without a page reload.

    * `{:phoenix_kit_file_thumbnail_updated, file_uuid}` — how the file's
      thumbnail should render changed: its baked annotated variant was
      regenerated/removed (`AnnotationThumbnailJob`), or its saved
      rotation moved (`MediaCanvasViewer`, which thumbnails apply as a CSS
      transform). Lighter than `file_processed`: consumers should refresh
      thumbnails only, not remount open viewers — the user is usually
      still working in one, and it is what emitted the change.

    * `{:phoenix_kit_file_trashed, file_uuid}` — the file was moved to
      trash (`trash_file/1`, or a `trash_folder/2` that swept it up).
      Consumers showing the active (non-trash) view should stop showing
      it; an open viewer on it should close.

    * `{:phoenix_kit_file_restored, file_uuid}` — the file was taken out
      of trash (`restore_file/1`, or a `restore_folder/2`). Consumers
      showing the trash view should stop showing it.

    * `{:phoenix_kit_file_deleted, file_uuid}` — the file was permanently
      deleted (`delete_file_completely/1`). Consumers should drop it
      wherever it is rendered and close an open viewer on it.

    * `{:phoenix_kit_files_trashed | :phoenix_kit_files_restored |
      :phoenix_kit_files_deleted, [file_uuid]}` — the same three, for every
      file a FOLDER operation swept up at once (`trash_folder/2`,
      `restore_folder/2`, `delete_folder_completely/2`), sent once per
      operation rather than once per file: a folder of thousands of files
      would otherwise be thousands of messages, and as many re-renders, for
      every subscriber. A consumer that reacts to one file must match both
      shapes (`uuid in uuids` for the bulk one).

  Lists files within the given scope with optional folder filter, search, and pagination.

  ## Options
    - `:folder_uuid` — specific folder within scope; returns `{:error, :out_of_scope}` if outside.
    - `:search` — ilike search on original_file_name; restricted to scope descendants when scope set.
    - `:include_orphaned` — boolean (default false); only meaningful when scope is nil.
      When true, returns only files with folder_uuid IS NULL.
      `include_orphaned: true` is ignored when `scope_folder_id` is non-nil (orphans are always outside any scope).
    - `:page` — page number (default 1).
    - `:per_page` — page size (default 20).
    - `:library_uuid` — only files in this storage library. Omitted means
      every library that is not private (`Libraries.exclude_private/1`).

  ## Returns
    `{files, total_count}` or `{:error, :out_of_scope}`.

  When `scope_folder_id == nil` and no `folder_uuid` is specified, ALL files are returned (not
  just orphans). To fetch orphans only at real root, pass `include_orphaned: true` AND use a

  # ===== FILE STORAGE OPERATIONS =====

  @doc """
  Stores a file in the storage system.

  This will:
  1. Store the file in multiple buckets based on redundancy settings
  2. Generate variants if enabled
  3. Create database records for the file and its variants

  ## Options

  - `:filename` - Original filename (required)
  - `:content_type` - MIME type (required)
  - `:size_bytes` - File size in bytes (required)
  - `:user_uuid` - **Required unless the file is system-owned.** The changeset
    rejects a non-system file with no owner, so omitting this returns a
    changeset error rather than an unowned file.
  - `:metadata` - Additional metadata map

  ## ⚠️ How to actually serve the stored file

  This is where hosts get stuck and hand-roll their own uploads instead.

  **`public_url/2` returns `nil` for the local provider.** That is not a bug or
  a missing feature — local files are deliberately not served from a public
  directory. Serve them through the signed route instead:

      PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.URLSigner.signed_url(file.uuid, "original")
      #=> "/phoenix_kit/file/<uuid>/original/<token>"

  which the router answers at `/file/:uuid/:variant/:token`. Pass a variant
  name (`"original"`, `"medium"`, …) to get that rendition.

  ### What the signature is and is not

  Treat these URLs as *obscured*, **not** as capability URLs, and do not use
  them for material where unauthorized access matters:

  - the token is the first 4 hex characters of an MD5 — a ~65k space, and
    brute-forceable for a targeted file;
  - tokens **never expire**, though the 401 says "Invalid or expired token";
  - with no `secret_key_base` the token degrades to a predictable no-secret hash.

  `/api/files/:uuid/info` no longer hands these URLs out anonymously — it now
  requires authentication and only answers for a file the caller owns (or an
  Owner/Admin). The token-strength and expiry points above remain open.

  These are recorded as known work in core's `AGENTS.md` under "Signed file-URL
  hardening". Current usage (public images) is within what the scheme actually
  provides; sensitive files are not.

  Stores a file in buckets with hierarchical path structure.

  ## Path Structure

  Files are stored using the pattern:
  `{user_uuid[0..1]}/{hash[0..1]}/{full_hash}/{full_hash}_{variant}.{format}`

  ## Options

    * `:mime_type` — the mime type the caller actually observed (a browser
      upload's `client_type`, a multipart `content_type`). Pass it whenever
      you have it: it is stored verbatim on the row, where omitting it falls
      back to guessing from the extension — which is how every mp3 in the
      wild ended up as `application/octet-stream`. A blank or octet-stream
      value is treated as absent.
    * `:library_uuid` — the storage library the new file goes into
      (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Libraries`); omitted means Media. A
      library with a `key_prefix` keys the file's objects under it
      (`{key_prefix}/{hash[0..1]}/{full_hash}/…`) instead of the uploader's
      prefix. A duplicate the same uploader already has is returned as it
      is, in whatever library it is in — compare `library_uuid` if that
      matters to you.

  Whatever `file_type` the caller claims is cross-checked against the mime
  evidence before the row is written (see `determine_file_type/2`) — a
  contradicted generic claim is corrected, so no single call site can poison
  the `file_type` column for every surface that filters on it.

  Classifies a file into the `file_type` the `File` schema stores:
  `"image"`, `"video"`, `"audio"`, `"document"`, `"archive"` or `"other"`.

  Every upload path must classify through here. Each surface used to carry its
  own copy of this `cond` and the copies drifted — three of them had no
  `audio/` clause at all, so an mp3 uploaded through the media browser was
  stored as `"document"` while the audio filter, a plain
  `file_type == "audio"` query, never saw it.

  `filename` is the second line of defence, for the extensions whose mime type
  neither the browser nor `MIME.from_path/1` knows.
