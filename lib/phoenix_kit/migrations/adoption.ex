defmodule PhoenixKit.Migrations.Adoption do
  @moduledoc """
  Public, documented API for module-owned migration chains that adopt a
  core-baseline table (`dev_docs/guides/2026-09-05-module-table-extraction-guide.md`)
  to verify its shape before claiming ownership — not just its presence.

  ## The bug this exists to let module authors close

  A module chain adopts a core table with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` /
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, then stamps ownership with
  `COMMENT ON TABLE ... IS '<marker_prefix><N>'`. `IF NOT EXISTS` checks
  *existence*, never *shape*: a column narrowed by hand outside migrations
  (say, a money column quietly changed from `numeric(15,2)` to
  `numeric(10,2)` by an operator working straight against the database)
  survives adoption completely silently — exit 0, marker written, the
  narrower type never noticed. This module closes that gap by giving a
  module's adoption step a way to assert "the table I am about to claim
  actually has the shape I expect" before it writes the marker.

  This module is a thin, **stability-committed** facade over
  `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair.Differ` and `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair.Probe`
  (core's existing structural-diff engine for `mix phoenix_kit.repair`) —
  unlike those two, which carry no external-API stability claim, this
  module's public functions are safe for a module package to depend on
  across core releases.

  ## `verify_shape/3` — the vocabulary

  `checks` is a flat list of per-object shape declarations, in the exact
  same `class`/`check`/`expected`-shape vocabulary
  `PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema` already uses internally for its
  own manifest entries (see `PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema.Object`'s
  moduledoc, "Per-class shape keys") — so a module author copies a
  familiar shape, not a novel one. A `:column` check, matching a real
  manifest entry's fields exactly:

      %{
        class: :column,
        check: {:catalog, %{kind: :column, table: "phoenix_kit_subscription_types", column: "price"}},
        expected: %{type: "numeric(15,2)", not_null: true, default: nil}
      }

  An `:index` check (a real, current core manifest entry —
  `phoenix_kit_users_username_uidx`, a partial unique index):

      %{
        class: :index,
        check: {:catalog, %{kind: :index, name: "phoenix_kit_users_username_uidx"}},
        expected: %{unique: true, method: "btree", keys: ["username"], opclasses: ["citext_ops"], predicate: "(username IS NOT NULL)"}
      }

  A `:constraint` check (primary key):

      %{
        class: :constraint,
        check: {:catalog, %{kind: :constraint, table: "phoenix_kit_orders", name: "phoenix_kit_orders_pkey"}},
        expected: %{type: "p", columns: ["uuid"]}
      }

  Only the fields `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair.Differ.compare/3` actually
  reads for that `class` need to be present in `expected` — see its
  moduledoc for the exact field list per class (columns: `type`,
  `not_null`, `default`; indexes: `unique`, `method`, `keys`, `opclasses`,
  `predicate`; constraints: dispatched on `expected.type`, see `Differ`).
  `verify_shape/3` validates this itself before ever calling `Differ` — see
  "Never raises, even on a malformed `checks` entry" below.

  ### Building a real `expected` map — don't hand-copy manifest source text

  `expected` values must be the CANONICAL text the querying server itself
  renders (`format_type`/`pg_get_expr`/`pg_get_indexdef` output) — never a
  SQL-source spelling. `character varying(120)`, never `varchar(120)`; a
  timestamp default is either `now()` or `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` depending on
  how it was declared, and those are two different strings that do **not**
  compare equal to each other. Any default expression that references a
  schema-qualified function or type must be qualified for the REAL prefix
  you are checking against, not the literal, unsubstituted
  `"__SCHEMA__"` placeholder token core's own manifest source carries
  internally — copying a manifest entry's raw fields by hand (e.g. by
  `grep`-ing `expected_schema.ex` and pasting what you find) reproduces
  that placeholder and manufactures a false drift on the very first check
  (`default: "__SCHEMA__.uuid_generate_v7()"` will never equal what a real
  connection reads back).

  The right way to build a real `expected` map from an actual, current core
  object is through the manifest's own public accessors, never by reading
  `expected_schema.ex`'s source directly:

      manifest = PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema.objects(prefix)
      object = Enum.find(manifest, &(&1.id == "column:phoenix_kit_subscription_types.price"))
      expected = PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema.Object.newest_shape(object)

  `ExpectedSchema.objects/1` already substitutes `"__SCHEMA__"` for the
  real, validated `prefix` you pass it — across every field, including
  every `:revisions` entry (the same per-object substitution
  `PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema.Object.materialize/2` performs;
  `objects/1` applies its own equivalent internally, so there is no need to
  call `materialize/2` again on what it returns). `Object.newest_shape/1`
  is the right shape to declare in `checks` for a table you are adopting
  NOW — but ONLY for an object your own module has never itself touched.
  Skip any object whose `presence` is `:legacy_optional` — spec §3.7's
  bimodal drift, where either state is normal on an old install, is not a
  shape a module's own fresh adoption should assert as required.

  ### `Object.newest_shape/1` is core's OWN idea of the shape — not
  necessarily what your module actually declares today

  If your module's own migration chain has already changed an object
  beyond what it inherited from core, `expected` for THAT object must come
  from YOUR module's own DDL/declared shape, not from core's manifest —
  core's `Object.newest_shape/1` still describes core's baseline, which may
  no longer be what's actually on the table. This is not hypothetical:
  `phoenix_kit_billing`'s own V5 migration does
  `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN user_uuid DROP NOT NULL` on both
  `phoenix_kit_invoices` and `phoenix_kit_transactions` — a deliberate,
  intentional widening — while core's manifest still declares `user_uuid`
  `NOT NULL` for both (core has not yet gone through the Phase 1 process,
  `@excluded_exact` + a manifest regeneration, for this specific change —
  see the extraction guide). A module using `Object.newest_shape/1`
  unmodified for `user_uuid` on either table would get a false drift on
  every single adoption run, forever, until core catches up. `shape_at/2`
  exists for the rarer case of deliberately pinning to an older, still-valid
  revision of an object your module has NOT modified; neither function is
  the right tool for an object your OWN module has changed — declare that
  `expected` by hand, from what your own DDL actually creates.

  `verify_shape/3` takes one `Probe.snapshot/2` of the target server, then
  runs every check against it and collects **every** drifted object in one
  pass — it never stops at the first mismatch, so a caller sees the full
  diff at once. An object the caller expects but that is entirely absent
  (dropped by a stray manual `DROP INDEX`, say) is reported as drift too,
  with its own `"missing: ..."` reason — this is deliberately not the same
  question `mix phoenix_kit.repair` answers (whether to *create* it); it is
  purely "does reality match what I declared".

  ### Never raises, even on a malformed `checks` entry

  `verify_shape/3` validates every `checks` entry completely before it
  ever reaches `Probe.lookup/2` or `Differ.compare/3` — neither of those
  was built to reject a bad input gracefully. All of the following are
  reported as drift, with an `"invalid check: ..."` reason, instead of
  crashing or silently passing:

    * the entry isn't a map, or is missing `:class`/`:check`/`:expected`
      (would otherwise be a `FunctionClauseError` at the call site);
    * `class` isn't a recognized class atom (`FunctionClauseError` from
      `Differ.compare/3`);
    * `check`'s own `kind` doesn't match the declared `class` — e.g.
      `class: :index` on a check that actually names a `:column`
      (`KeyError` from `Differ.compare/3` reading an index-shaped field
      off a column-shaped observed map), or, more dangerously,
      `class: :table` on a check that names a `:column`: `Differ.compare(
      :table, _, _)` always returns `:match` regardless of content, so
      THIS specific mismatch doesn't crash at all — it silently reports a
      genuinely narrowed column as clean. Cross-checking `class` against
      `check`'s `kind` closes that hole, not just the crashing ones;
    * `expected` isn't a map at all (`BadMapError` from `Map.has_key?/2`);
    * `expected` is a map but is missing a field that `class` needs
      (`KeyError` from `Differ.compare/3`'s own field reads).

  Because this module is **stability-committed** for external callers
  (see above), a caller mistake in its own `checks` list must surface as a
  clear signal inside the normal `{:drift, diffs}` result, not a cryptic
  internal crash from a module the caller does not own — and never a
  silent `:ok` either, which is the more dangerous failure mode of the
  two. This promise is specific to `verify_shape/3`; `marker_conflict/5`
  makes no equivalent "never raises" claim (its documented `{:error, _}`
  return covers real query/existence failures, not caller input errors).

  ### `~deparse~`-marked reasons are full-severity drift here, unlike in `mix phoenix_kit.repair`

  `Differ`'s `:index` predicate and `:constraint` (`"c"`/`"x"`) definition
  comparisons fall back to raw `pg_get_expr`/`pg_get_constraintdef`
  rendering (see `Differ`'s own moduledoc) — two Postgres majors can
  re-render an identical expression differently, so a reason resting only
  on that text (`Differ.deparse_text_only?/1`) is not always real drift.
  `mix phoenix_kit.repair` downgrades such a reason to informational on an
  unverified major (its own server-version preflight,
  `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair`'s `@supported_pg_majors`). `verify_shape/3`
  deliberately does **not** mirror that: it has no report/severity-tier
  system of its own to hang an `:info` vs `:error` distinction on, and
  introducing one would be new machinery this module does not otherwise
  need. Adoption is also a rare, deliberate, operator-supervised migration
  step — not a routine health check — so treating a possible cross-major
  rendering artifact as full drift (rather than silently accepting it) is
  the safer default here: worst case, a module author sees a reason to
  double-check by hand; `format_drift/1` still renders it plainly (stripped
  of the internal marker prefix). If this proves too strict for a real
  cross-major deployment, a module author's option today is to adjust its
  own `expected` declaration for that specific object.

  ## The recommended pattern: verify, then decline-and-raise on drift — or,
  under an explicit operator opt-in, warn and adopt anyway

  `verify_shape/3` never raises on anything in its `checks` argument (see
  "Never raises" above — that promise is `verify_shape/3`'s specifically;
  `marker_conflict/5` DOES raise on a malformed CALL — an empty
  `own_marker_prefix`, or a `prefix` `Helpers.validate_prefix!/1` rejects —
  those are programmer errors in how the function was called, not data the
  function is meant to report on the way `checks`/drift is). Neither
  function ever *writes* to the database — `verify_shape/3` does run a
  real, read-only `Probe.snapshot/2` of the target server (which briefly
  sets `search_path = ''` on the connection for the duration of the
  snapshot; see `Probe`'s own moduledoc for why), but neither function ever
  executes DDL or writes a comment. **This module is deliberately
  mode-agnostic** — it reports; the calling module chain decides how to
  react. The following is the decided, shared contract for that reaction,
  common to this module and `phoenix_kit_legal`'s own adoption step (its
  issue #23) — not something `Adoption` enforces itself.

  Run the additive `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT
  EXISTS` statements first (as today), `flush()` them so they have
  actually landed, then verify shape, then react to the result:

    * **By default** — decline the marker and **raise**, with the diff
      rendered into the message via `format_drift/1`. Never silently skip,
      never auto-repair.
    * **Under an explicit, per-host operator opt-in** (a config toggle the
      module chain itself reads — e.g. `Application.get_env(:my_module,
      :adoption_shape_check, :raise) == :warn`; the exact key is the
      module's own choice, this module does not define or read one) —
      render the SAME diff via `format_drift/1` into an
      `Logger.error/1` call instead of a raise, **write the ownership
      marker anyway**, and let the migration succeed and the chain's
      version advance. The migration must NOT fail in `:warn` mode:
      `mix phoenix_kit.update` regenerates a module's migration file on
      every run it is invoked for, and a migration that never completes
      would be regenerated and re-attempted forever. `:warn` accepts the
      drift, it does not hide it — but the `:error`-level log line at the
      moment of adoption is the durable record of that, not a promise that
      a LATER `mix phoenix_kit.repair`/`doctor` run will independently
      rediscover the same drift: `Differ` itself excludes the
      `not_null: true, default: nil` shape from comparison entirely (the
      same exemption this module separately compensates for — see below —
      repair has no such compensation, so it would never have seen that
      specific drift either), and any object a module has since gone
      through Phase 1 for (`@excluded_exact`, core's manifest regenerated
      to match the module's new shape) simply stops being asserted by core
      at all, at which point repair/doctor cannot see it as a mismatch by
      design, not by omission.

  This is an explicit, reviewed, per-host operator decision — never a
  default, never something a module flips on for itself. It exists for the
  same reason `marker_conflict/5`'s `overwritable:` option exists: some
  hosts have a legitimate, already-understood reason their shape does not
  match, and the alternative to a deliberate override is adoption never
  completing on that host at all.

  This same pattern (default raise, `:warn` opt-in) is mirrored, in short
  form, in `dev_docs/guides/2026-09-05-module-table-extraction-guide.md`.

  A real module chain's coordinator implements `up(opts \\\\ [])` (the
  decentralized-migrations contract `mix phoenix_kit.update` discovers via
  `migration_module/0`) and is itself invoked from *inside* a real,
  generated `Ecto.Migration` callback — so `execute/1` and `repo()` (both
  from `Ecto.Migration`, available because the coordinator does
  `use Ecto.Migration`) are the real DDL/repo-access mechanism, not
  `repo.query!/2`. `execute/1` only *queues* a command on the migration
  runner (`Ecto.Migration.Runner`) — it does not run it immediately — so a
  `flush()` between the queued `CREATE TABLE` and the read `verify_shape/3`
  performs is required, or the verify would see the table as entirely
  *missing* rather than checking its shape at all:

      defmodule MyModule.Migrations do
        use Ecto.Migration
        require Logger
        alias PhoenixKit.Migrations.Adoption

        @marker_prefix "mym_schema:"

        def up(opts \\\\ []) do
          prefix = Keyword.get(opts, :prefix, "public")
          repo = repo()
          p = "\#{prefix}."

          execute(\"\"\"
          CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \#{p}phoenix_kit_subscription_types (
            "uuid" uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT \#{p}uuid_generate_v7(),
            "price" numeric(15,2) NOT NULL
          )
          \"\"\")

          # `execute/1` above only QUEUES the CREATE on the migration runner —
          # `flush()` forces it to actually land before the read below, or
          # verify_shape/3 would see the table as missing, not as drift.
          flush()

          checks = [
            %{
              class: :column,
              check:
                {:catalog,
                 %{kind: :column, table: "phoenix_kit_subscription_types", column: "price"}},
              expected: %{type: "numeric(15,2)", not_null: true, default: nil}
            }
          ]

          case Adoption.verify_shape(repo, prefix, checks) do
            :ok -> :ok
            {:drift, diffs} -> handle_drift(diffs)
          end

          case Adoption.marker_conflict(
                 repo,

        end

        # instead — `up/1` then proceeds to write the marker anyway and

        # than regenerating and re-attempting this same migration forever.
        # The drift stays visible in the log either way; `:warn` accepts
        # it, it does not hide it.
        defp handle_drift(diffs) do

              MyModule's own `expected` declaration if the drift is \\
              intentional, or set `:adoption_shape_check` to `:warn` for \\
              this host if you have reviewed the diff above and accept it. \\
              Re-run this migration once you have done one of those.
              \"\"\"
          end
        end
      end

  ### Why decline-and-raise, not auto-fix

  Auto-fixing DDL during unattended adoption (at app boot, with no operator
  watching) carries the same silent-mutation risk this module exists to
  close, just inverted — a column silently widened back is a smaller but
  structurally identical mistake to a column silently narrowed: the host's
  schema changes without anyone being told. `mix phoenix_kit.repair`
  remains the one tool that ever issues DDL automatically — but only for
  CORE's own tables, adding a genuinely missing column or index it created
  in the first place. For a module-adopted table specifically, as the
  worked example's raise message above notes, repair cannot help at all
  (it is additive-only, and has no notion of module ownership) — a real
  fix here is always a manual one. Keeping adoption's own shape check
  detection-only mirrors the same principle for the one case where no
  tool, repair included, can safely auto-correct: detection is safe to run
  unattended, DDL mutation is not. An unhandled `raise` during a migration
  halts the chain (the version marker is never advanced), so the host does
  not boot into a half-adopted state and the operator sees exactly what
  disagreed.

  "Auto-fix" and "operator override" are different things, and only the
  first is ruled out here. `:warn` (above) is a documented, deliberate
  *override* — an operator explicitly saying "I have reviewed this drift
  and accept it, adopt anyway" — not automatic repair: nothing DDL-wise
  changes about the table itself, only whether the marker gets written
  over the drift instead of adoption halting. The mode switch lives in the
  calling module, not here, by design (see above).

  ## `marker_conflict/5`

  Reads the current `COMMENT ON TABLE` for an arbitrary, caller-given
  table (not core's own `phoenix_kit` meta table — this is a new,
  parameterized query, schema-anchored the same way
  `PhoenixKit.Migrations.Repair.Probe.raw_comment/2` anchors its read of
  core's own marker). `:ok` when the comment is absent, `nil`, already
  starts with the caller's own `own_marker_prefix` (an ordinary version
  bump by the SAME module), or is a known core pre-squash legacy
  descriptive comment (see below); `{:conflict, existing_comment}` for
  anything else — another module's marker, or an operator's own
  hand-written documentation comment on the table — so the caller can
  decline to overwrite it rather than silently stomping it.
  `{:error, reason}` when the query itself failed — this is deliberately
  distinct from `:ok`; a caller that cannot tell whether a conflict exists
  must not proceed as if there is none.

  `own_marker_prefix` must be non-empty (an empty string would make every
  comment match `String.starts_with?(comment, "")` and this function would
  always report `:ok`, defeating the whole check) and must include the
  same trailing separator the caller's own marker-write statement uses
  (the existing convention across `phoenix_kit_billing`/`phoenix_kit_legal`
  is a trailing colon, e.g. `"pkb_schema:"`) — a prefix without it risks a
  false match against an unrelated but similarly-named module
  (`"pkb_schema"` would also match a hypothetical `"pkb_schema_v2:1"`).

  ### Core's own pre-squash legacy comments

  Before the squash at V135, core itself wrote plain descriptive (not
  marker-shaped) `COMMENT ON TABLE` statements on baseline tables — not
  only the handful billing/legal happen to adopt today, but essentially
  every table core created before the squash, ~48 in total (storage,
  posts/social, billing, AI, support tickets, user relationships, db sync,
  shop, consent — see `@core_legacy_table_comments` for the exact table
  list and text, confirmed by reading every descriptive `COMMENT ON TABLE`
  in the pre-squash source directly, not a partial sample). On any host
  installed before the squash, that text is still there for whichever of
  those tables it created — not `nil`, not the adopting module's own
  marker prefix. `marker_conflict/5` treats an exact match against one of
  these known strings, for its own table, as automatically overwritable
  (the same outcome as "no comment"), so a correctly-written adoption step
  does not fail on any pre-squash host adopting any core-baseline table —
  not just the ones known modules adopt today, but future ones too (the
  next module in the extraction series adopting, say, `phoenix_kit_posts`
  or `phoenix_kit_tickets`, hits the same class of host and is already
  covered).

  `overwritable:` is for a comment `marker_conflict/5` does NOT already
  recognize as safe — core's own pre-squash comments are covered
  automatically by the list above and never need this option. Typical use:
  an operator's own hand-written note on the table, independently reviewed
  and confirmed safe to overwrite for this specific adoption:

      Adoption.marker_conflict(repo, prefix, table, @marker_prefix,
        overwritable: ["an operator's own note, reviewed and confirmed safe"]
      )

  This does not widen what counts as safe by default — only the two
  sources above (core's own known list, and whatever the CALLER
  explicitly supplies) are ever treated as overwritable; anything else
  still declines with `{:conflict, existing_comment}`.
