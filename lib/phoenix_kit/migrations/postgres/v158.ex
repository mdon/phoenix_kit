defmodule PhoenixKit.Migrations.Postgres.V158 do
  @moduledoc """
  V158: broadcast attachments (accumulator).

  Per the one-open-migration rule this file is the accumulator for the
  restructuring work until it ships in a release; later sections append
  here rather than opening V159.

  ## Section: `phoenix_kit_newsletters_broadcasts.attachments`

  A JSONB array of Storage file uuids (`phoenix_kit_files.uuid`) to be
  attached to every email of the broadcast. Deliberately a bare uuid
  list, not an FK'd join table:

  - The soft-reference pattern matches this table's existing
    `crm_list_uuid`/`source_params` precedent — newsletters rows never
    hold FKs into other modules' tables, so a file deleted from Media
    later degrades to "skipped at send time" (the worker resolves each
    uuid via Storage and skips misses) rather than blocking the delete
    with a RESTRICT nobody can see the reason for.
  - Order matters to the sender (attachments appear in the email in list
    order), which a join table would need an extra column to preserve;
    a JSONB array carries it for free.

  The application-side writer (broadcast editor + `Broadcast` changeset,
  newsletters package) validates entries are uuids and caps the count;
  the column itself only guarantees "a JSON array" via the CHECK — the
  DB-level backstop that a stray writer can't store an object/scalar
  here and crash every reader.

  All operations idempotent.
