defmodule PhoenixKit.Integrations.Probe do
  @moduledoc """
  Runs a connection check in an isolated process under a hard deadline.

  Connection checks talk to the network, and the libraries behind them bound
  neither their runtime nor their crashes:

    * `:gen_smtp_client.open/1` runs in the **calling** process and, past the TCP
      connect, waits on a hard-coded `?TIMEOUT` of 1_200_000 ms — the `timeout`
      option bounds only `connect`. A tarpit relay parks the caller for twenty
      minutes.
    * ExAws retries transport errors with backoff, which adds up to minutes.

  Every call site is a LiveView callback, so the check must be watched in **both**
  directions, and getting only one of them right is worse than getting neither:

    * **The check must not kill the caller.** `Task.async/1` links, and a LiveView
      does not trap exits, so a raise or an abnormal exit inside the check killed
      the operator's page outright — before `Task.yield/2` could hand back
      `{:exit, reason}`, which is why that clause never ran.
    * **The caller must not lose the check.** With a bare `spawn_monitor/1` the
      deadline lives in the caller's `receive/after`, so when the LiveView goes
      away mid-check — the operator hit refresh — nothing is left to fire it. The
      check stays parked in gen_smtp for twenty minutes holding its socket, and,
      being unlinked, it is now unreachable rather than merely slow. That is the
      first hazard relocated, not removed.

  So: **link, monitor, and unlink before dying** — which is exactly what
  LiveView's own `start_async` does (phoenix_live_view/async.ex: `Task.start_link/1`,
  then a monitor on top, then the work wrapped in `try/after Process.unlink/1`).
  The link reaps the check when the
  caller dies; the monitor delivers the result and the crash reason; unlinking
  before dying keeps the check's own failure from travelling back up the link. At
  the deadline the caller unlinks *before* killing, because `:kill` is untrappable
  — the check cannot unlink itself, and the link would carry `:killed` straight
  back.

  The one signal a link necessarily carries is an untrappable `:kill` of the check
  process by a third party. Nothing holds its pid, so nothing can; `Task` and
  LiveView accept the same exposure.
