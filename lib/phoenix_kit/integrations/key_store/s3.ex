defmodule PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore.S3 do
  @moduledoc """
  Optional off-host copy of the encryption secret, in an S3-compatible bucket.

  AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Tigris, MinIO — anything the existing
  `ex_aws_s3` dependency talks to. **Optional in the strong sense**: PhoenixKit
  works with no bucket, no AWS account and no network. Use it as a second member
  of `PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore.Chain`, behind the local file, so the
  bucket is a spare copy rather than the thing everything depends on:

      config :phoenix_kit,
        integrations_key_store:
          {PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore.Chain,
           stores: [
             PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore.File,
             {PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore.S3, bucket: "my-ops-bucket"}
           ]}

  ## Why the credentials do NOT come from an integration connection

  The obvious idea is to configure this through the integrations system, the
  same way any other provider is configured. It cannot carry the read path, and
  the reason is structural rather than a matter of effort.

  An integration connection's `secret_key` is in
  `PhoenixKit.Integrations.Encryption.sensitive_fields/0`, so it is stored
  **encrypted with the integration key**. Reading the secret out of a bucket
  whose credentials are themselves encrypted under that secret requires the
  secret you are trying to fetch. Writes work — during a rotation the old key is
  live, so the credentials decrypt — which is the dangerous part: it would
  produce a backup that is written successfully and can never be restored from.
  A backup you cannot restore from is worse than none, because you stop looking
  for a real one.

  So credentials come from `ExAws`'s own resolution: environment variables, an
  instance role, or an explicit `:ex_aws_config`. On AWS with an instance role
  there is no stored secret at all, which removes the circularity completely.

  What the integrations system *can* usefully hold is the part that is not
  secret — which bucket, which region, which object — and that is a later,
  separate step; nothing here needs it.

  ## What is stored

  One object, the secret as its body, written with `AES256` server-side
  encryption. Bucket-side access control is the operator's to set: this module
  refuses to pretend it can make a public bucket safe.
