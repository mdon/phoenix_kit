defmodule PhoenixKit.Settings.History do
  @moduledoc """
  The history of site settings: what each setting was, and since when.

  ## Why

  A stored instant does not say which regime wrote it. When the `time_zone`
  setting moved from an integer offset to an IANA id and several modules
  turned out to have added that value to other instants, the rows they had
  written could not be repaired: nothing recorded when the setting changed
  or what it was before. `phoenix_kit_settings.date_updated` holds the last
  change only, and no settings writer logged anything.

  ## Where it lives

  In the activity feed, as `setting.changed` entries that are **permanent**
  (the pruner keeps them whatever their age), so there is one record of who
  did what, and the admin's Activity page shows settings changes beside
  everything else. The entry is inserted inside the settings write's
  transaction and published to the feed's subscribers only after the commit
  — nobody hears of a change that rolled back.

  Every write through `PhoenixKit.Settings` that changes a value records
  one entry: `metadata` carries the `key`, the value `from` and `to` (a
  JSON setting as its encoded document), the `source` (`"settings"` for the
  admin pages, `"system"` otherwise); `actor_uuid` is the person when one
  made the change; `resource_uuid` is the setting row. The value before is
  read under a row lock inside the write's transaction, so two racing
  writers cannot both record the same old value. A write that leaves the
  value as it was records nothing. A restricted (secret) setting records
  that a change happened — `restricted: true`, both values withheld.

  ## Reading it

    * `list/2` — the changes to one key, newest first.
    * `value_at/2` — the value a key had at an instant: the answer to "which
      timezone was this site on when that row was written?".

  The newest change at or before the instant says what the value became;

  setting that was never changed since recording began is ASSUMED to have
  always been what it is now. A JSON setting is its encoded document, the
  same shape the history holds. A `DateTime` in any zone is the instant it
  names, not its wall clock. A restricted key answers `nil` for every
  instant: its values are withheld from the history and this must not
  become the way around that — and a key that WAS restricted when a change
  was recorded answers `nil` for that period even after it stops being
  restricted, because the value was never written down.
