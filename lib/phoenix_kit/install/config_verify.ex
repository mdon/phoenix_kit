  I103: the config-editing helpers across `oban_config.ex`, `phoenix_kit.update.ex`,
  `boot_hook.ex`, and `runtime_detector.ex` all splice text into a host's own
  `.ex`/`.exs` file via regex, then hand the result back without ever checking
  what they produced. Two independent ways that goes wrong, found the same day:

    * The splice lands on the wrong delimiter (a `]` inside a comment, inside a
      string) and produces text that is not valid Elixir at all — reproduced
      live as `MismatchedDelimiterError` from `add_scheduled_posts_job_to_crontab/1`
      given nothing more unusual than an ordinary explanatory comment.
    * The splice lands on the wrong delimiter and STILL produces valid Elixir —
      the new entry ends up nested inside an unrelated value (an existing
      entry's own `args: %{tags: [...]}` list) instead of as a sibling of the
      list it was meant to join. A parse check alone accepts this silently;
      it is the exact shape of a green that doesn't back its own claim, same
      as I082's doctor check before it named its own scope.

  This module is the shared fix for both: parse the candidate text, then hand
  the parsed AST to a caller-supplied predicate that confirms the SPECIFIC
  change is actually present where it was meant to land — not just that some
  valid Elixir came out. Either failure returns the ORIGINAL, untouched
  content plus a reason a caller turns into the same kind of manual-fallback
  message the safe call sites in this codebase already print. A rollback is
  never worse than what the file had before; a wrong bracket must never win
  silently over "tell the operator to do it by hand".

  ## What this deliberately does NOT cover

  `PhoenixKit.Install.JsIntegration` and `PhoenixKit.Install.CssIntegration`
  splice regex-built text into a host's `assets/js/app.js`,
  `root.html.heex`, and `app.css` the same way — but `Code.string_to_quoted/1`
  only understands Elixir, so there is no equivalent parse-then-verify step
  for JavaScript, HEEX, or CSS available here. That is a real, permanent gap
  in coverage, not an oversight: those splices stay regex-only, checked (where
  they are checked at all) by a plain `if updated != content` before writing.
  Each site says so in its own comment.
