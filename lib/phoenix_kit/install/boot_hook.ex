# Igniter-only helper: every caller is a `mix phoenix_kit.*` igniter task,
# which is itself guarded the same way. Igniter is an OPTIONAL dependency
# (see mix.exs), so a host that scopes it to `only: [:dev, :test]` compiles
# :prod without it — unguarded, this module emitted
# "Igniter.X is undefined" warnings on every production build.

    Wires `PhoenixKit.boot/1` into the parent app's `Application.start/2`.

    `PhoenixKit.boot/1` rescans for late-loading `:phoenix_kit_<x>` deps and
    runs registered modules' `migrate_legacy/0`. It must be called after
    `Supervisor.start_link/2` succeeds.

    Idempotent — if `PhoenixKit.boot` is already present in the file, this
    helper is a no-op. Called from both `mix phoenix_kit.install` and
    `mix phoenix_kit.update`.

    ## Standard form

    Matches the canonical Phoenix generator output:

        Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)

    and rewrites it to:

        Supervisor.start_link(children, opts) |> PhoenixKit.boot()

    Non-standard shapes (custom variable names, piped form, calls wrapped
    in `case`/`with`) are left untouched and surface as an Igniter warning
    with manual-edit instructions.
