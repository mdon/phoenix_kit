defmodule PhoenixKit.Jobs.Engine do
  @moduledoc """
  The transactional core of job runs. Not the public API — that is
  `PhoenixKit.Jobs`, which checks permissions and takes a `Scope`; this module
  trusts its caller and does the I/O the pure `PhoenixKit.Jobs.StateMachine`
  decides.

  **Every transition is one transaction**: the row is locked (`FOR UPDATE`), the
  state machine says what changes and what to do besides, the changes are
  written, the Oban job a dispatch asks for is inserted, and the Activity entry
  is inserted — all or nothing. The PubSub broadcast, the feed's broadcast and
  the kind's `on_finish/2` happen **after** the commit.

  Because the row is locked, a pause that races a checkpoint is serialised: it
  either commits first (the checkpoint then sees `pausing` and dispatches
  nothing) or after (it then sees the batch is done). That is what a re-read of
  the state before an enqueue could not give.

  ## Not inside another transaction

  The promise above — nothing is published or finished before the commit — can
  only be kept when this module's transaction is the outermost one. Called from
  inside a host's `Repo.transaction/1` or an `Ecto.Multi`, the commit is the
  host's, and an event or an `on_finish/2` would escape a transaction that may
  still roll back. Every entry point therefore refuses to run there and answers
  `{:error, :in_transaction}` before writing anything: call `PhoenixKit.Jobs`
  after your transaction commits.

  ## Dispatch

  A dispatch bumps `generation` (the state machine puts it in the changes) and
  inserts a `PhoenixKit.Jobs.RunWorker` job carrying that generation. A job of an
  older generation finds a mismatch when it tries to claim and does nothing.
  When Oban is not running (a web-only node, a script) the insert is skipped,
  the run keeps its new generation and no job, and the sweeper — or the next
  node that runs Oban — recovers it.
