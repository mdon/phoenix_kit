defmodule PhoenixKit.Jobs.SweepWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Finds the runs that stopped without saying so and puts them right — the
  run-level twin of `Oban.Plugins.Lifeline` (which only rescues the Oban row).
  Cron, every five minutes (`mix phoenix_kit.update` adds the entry to existing
  hosts).

  The sweeper only **lists candidates** (unfinished runs untouched for
  `@grace_seconds`). Whether one needs help is decided by
  `PhoenixKit.Jobs.Engine.recover/4` under the run's row lock, from the run as it
  is at that moment — a run a live worker advanced, rescued or claimed since the
  listing is left alone, so a slow sweep can never undo a newer dispatch
  (`dev_docs/plans/2026-10-03-job-runs.md`, §16 F1).

  It reads each run's **own Oban job** (`oban_job_id`, checked to be this run's
  `RunWorker` job of this generation), through Oban's configured repo and prefix
  (`PhoenixKit.Jobs.ObanStore`), never "is there any job" and never a stale
  heartbeat alone (§14 R5). **When Oban cannot be asked — no instance runs in this
  VM — every run that depends on a dispatch is left, one that never had a job id
  included**, so a sweep from a script cannot spend a rescue on a dispatch nothing
  here could have made:

  | the run | what it has | action |
  |---|---|---|
  | holds a **queue** claim | its job is `executing` | leave it (Lifeline owns a genuinely dead one) |
  | holds a **queue** claim | its job is anything else | the batch died: **release** the claim |
  | holds an **inline** claim | a lease still running | leave it |
  | holds an **inline** claim | a lease that ran out (`Run.lease_expired?/2`) | the script died: **release** the claim |
  | **inline**, between two batches (waiting out a delay) | a lease still running | leave it: the script will be back at `wake_at` |
  | **inline**, between two batches | a lease that ran out | **rescue** — the dispatch carries the rest of the delay |
  | waiting | `available`, `scheduled`, `retryable`, `executing` | leave it |
  | waiting | `discarded` | its attempts are spent: the run **fails** |
  | waiting | `cancelled` outside the engine | the run **fails** |
  | waiting | `completed`, or gone, or of another generation | a lost dispatch: **rescue** |

  A script (`Jobs.run_inline/3`) has no Oban job, so a missing job proves nothing
  about it; its claim carries a lease (an hour without a `Jobs.heartbeat/1`) which
  also covers the waits between its batches (`wake_at` plus the lease).
  The limitation is deliberate: a crashed script's run stays held until its lease
  runs out, and a new script may take it over then.

  A rescue gives the run a new generation and dispatches it, and is counted on the
  row (`rescues`), so the budget survives restarts; at `@rescue_limit` the run fails
  instead of restarting for ever. A run changed in the last `@grace_seconds` is
  left alone: its dispatch may be in flight.

  Each pass stamps `job_runs_last_sweep_at`, which the Jobs page reads to warn when
  no sweeper has been seen.
