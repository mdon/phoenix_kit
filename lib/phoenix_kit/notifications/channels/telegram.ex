defmodule PhoenixKit.Notifications.Channels.Telegram do
  @moduledoc """
  Telegram notification channel — delivers a user's notifications to Telegram,
  through their own bot or through the site's.

  There's nothing to configure on the notifications page: the channel
  **auto-discovers** where to send.

  ## Personal bot

  The recipient's own Telegram integration connections, and the chat(s)
  captured on them (during Test on the integration form). A personal bot wins
  over the site's: someone who set one up wants it used. Each connection carries
  a `mode`:

    * `"single"` — auto-capture locks one private chat (the owner's), so a
      stranger who messages the bot right after them is not picked up.
    * `"multi"` — every chat that has started the bot → a broadcast.

  The mode governs auto-capture only: the owner can also link a chat by id
  (a group, a channel), so `chat_ids` is not capped by it. The channel sends
  to every id on the list and does not care which kind each one is.

  ## Site bot

  When the recipient has no personal bot linked, the site's bot delivers —
  if the admin chose one (`Telegram.SiteBot`) and the recipient linked their
  chat to it (`Telegram.Linking`). The chat id is read from `config`
  (`"site_chat_id"`), and the bot comes from the site setting, never from the
  user's config: a link made to a bot that is no longer the site's bot is not
  honoured, so changing the bot cannot send one person's messages through a
  stranger's.

  A failure of the site bot itself (revoked token, deleted connection, a 401 or
  404) is transient: it hits every linked user alike, so it must not switch
  anyone's channel off. Only errors about the chat (blocked, kicked,
  deactivated, chat not found) are permanent there.

  `configured?/2` is true once the recipient has somewhere to send. Bot tokens
  are resolved owner-scoped at send time — this module never handles them.

  The `config` arg (the `notification_channel:telegram` blob) carries routing/
  cadence and, for the site bot, the linked chat.
