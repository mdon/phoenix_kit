defmodule PhoenixKit.Notifications.Channel do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for a notification **delivery channel** — an external destination a
  user can route their notifications to (Telegram, email, …), on top of the
  in-app inbox.

  Channels are pluggable: core ships some, feature modules contribute more via
  `PhoenixKit.Module`'s `notification_channels/0`, and
  `PhoenixKit.Notifications.Channels.list/0` merges them. Adding a channel is
  "implement this behaviour + register it" — the notifications core, the routing
  layer, the delivery worker, and the settings UI all work off the behaviour, so
  none of them change.

  ## Contract shape (why it's built this way)

  - **`deliver/2` takes an `t:envelope/0`, not a raw notification.** The envelope
    is a channel-neutral, already-rendered payload with an **absolute** URL — so a
    channel never reaches into the notification/activity schema and every channel
    gets the same well-formed input. Channels that need more structure (email
    wants subject + HTML) read the extra envelope fields; simple ones use `:text`.
    The recipient's locale rides along in `:locale` for channels that localize,
    but the core's built-in rendering is English today (i18n of the rendered
    strings is not wired yet) — so treat `:locale` as a hint, not a guarantee
    the `:text` is already translated.
  - **Results carry a permanent/transient taxonomy.** `deliver/2` returns
    `t:result/0` so the delivery worker can decide retry-vs-give-up generically,
    instead of every channel leaking its own retry policy (e.g. "bot blocked" is
    permanent, a 429/timeout is transient with an optional `retry_after`).
  - **`configured?/2` and `validate_config/1` keep per-user setup out of the
    core.** The router asks `configured?/2` before enqueuing; the settings page
    asks `validate_config/1` before saving.

  The per-user config map (`t:config/0`) is opaque to the core — its shape is the
  channel's business — except that the core stores it under
  `custom_fields["notification_channel:<key>"]` and reads the reserved
  `"enabled"` / `"types"` keys for routing (see
  `PhoenixKit.Notifications.ChannelConfig`).
