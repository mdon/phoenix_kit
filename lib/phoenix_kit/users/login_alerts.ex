defmodule PhoenixKit.Users.LoginAlerts do
  @moduledoc """
  New-login security alerts ("we noticed a new login to your account").

  On every login (`PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth.log_in_user/3`), the request's
  `(ip_address, user_agent_hash)` pair is checked against
  `PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.KnownDevice` rows for that user, and a row is
  persisted for every new pair either way (still used to enrich the
  self-service "Active Sessions" list with browser/OS/location per
  session — see `PhoenixKit.Users.Sessions.list_user_device_sessions/2`).
  A `user.new_login_detected` activity entry is always logged too, for the
  audit trail.

  The reader-facing alarms — the email
  (`PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.UserNotifier.deliver_new_login_alert/2`, gated
  behind `new_login_alert_enabled`) and the in-app notification — are
  narrower than "unrecognized pair", though, and are skipped when either:

    * this is the very first `KnownDevice` row the account has ever had
      (see below), or
    * the browser/OS (`user_agent_hash` alone, regardless of IP) HAS been
      seen before for this account — an IP alone changing is not "a new
      device" from the user's point of view. Most residential/mobile
      connections don't have a static IP, so alerting on IP change alone
      fires on a large fraction of logins from an already-trusted browser
      and trains people to ignore the email — the exact alert-fatigue
      failure this codebase already avoids elsewhere (see
      `PhoenixKit.Utils.SessionFingerprint`, which treats an IP-only
      mismatch as a mere warning, never an alarm).

  The first-device skip exists because registration ends by logging the new
  user in through this exact path (`log_in_user/3`), and an account with no
  device history yet cannot help but treat its own signup as "a new device" —
  without it, every signup on an installation with alerts on immediately
  received a "we noticed a new login" security email about the login it just
  performed to finish registering. The device is still recorded (so the
  *second* login, from anywhere else, correctly reads as new), and the
  activity entry still logs for the audit trail — only the two
  reader-facing alarms are suppressed.

  A recognized `(ip, ua)` pair just bumps `last_seen_at` — no alert, no email.

  Sends synchronously (matching every other PhoenixKit auth email —
  confirmation, password reset, magic link — none of which are queued
  through Oban): a "new device" login is inherently rare per user (every
  subsequent login from the same device is silent), so the odd extra
  round-trip on a first-time login doesn't justify background-job
  infrastructure this feature would otherwise be the only user of. A
  send failure is logged and swallowed — it must never block sign-in.
