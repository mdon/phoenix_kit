defmodule PhoenixKit.Users.TimeZoneAlert do
  @moduledoc """
  Notices when someone is browsing from a timezone their account does not use,
  and tells them once.

  The browser is the only party that knows where a person actually is, so the
  `TimezoneDetector` hook reports its IANA zone from every authenticated page.
  This module decides whether that is worth saying anything about.

  ## What counts as a mismatch

  Only a difference that would put the wrong clock time on screen:

    * Zones in the **same behaviour group** are not a mismatch.
      `Europe/Tallinn` and `Europe/Helsinki` never disagree, in any season, so
      an account set to one while browsing from the other is fine and silent.
    * A **legacy numeric offset** is always worth replacing. Even when it is
      right today it cannot follow the next daylight-saving change, which is
      the defect the identifiers were introduced to fix.

  ## Telling them once

  A notification fires at most once per detected zone, remembered in the user's
  `custom_fields`. Someone who travels for a week gets one notification on
  arrival, not one per page view — and one more when they get home, because
  that is a different zone from the one last alerted about.

  The activity is logged with **no actor**: nobody did this, the system
  observed it. That also matters mechanically, since
  `Notifications.maybe_create_from_activity/1` skips fan-out when the actor is
  the target, and here the target is the only person involved.
