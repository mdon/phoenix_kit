defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.CommentsForwarding do
  @moduledoc """
  Forwards Leaf rich-text editor process messages to the optional
  `phoenix_kit_comments` package.

  The embedded `CommentsComponent`'s Leaf composer reports its content to the
  *host* LiveView via a `{:leaf_changed, _}` process message — LiveComponents
  can't receive `handle_info` themselves. The host must forward that message
  back into the component, or "Post Comment" silently posts empty content.

  `phoenix_kit_comments` is an optional sibling dependency with no compile-order
  guarantee, so the call is resolved at runtime via `apply/3` (never a
  compile-time-bound `mod.fun(...)` call) and degrades to a no-op when the
  package is absent.

  Used by `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser.Embed` (macro-injected handler)
  and `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Users.MediaDetail` (inline handler) — both delegate
  their `{:leaf_changed, _}` `handle_info` clause here so the optional-dep
  contract lives in one place.

  Forwards a `{:leaf_changed, _}` message to the comments component.

  Always returns `{:noreply, socket}`, so it can be used directly as the body of
  a host `handle_info({:leaf_changed, _} = msg, socket)` clause. When the
  comments package is absent (or its `forward_leaf_event/2` contract drifts) the
  message is dropped gracefully — and contract drift is logged.
