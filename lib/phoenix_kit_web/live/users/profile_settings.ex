defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Users.ProfileSettings do
  @moduledoc """
  "Profile Settings" — the signed-in user's own account page.

  Email, password, connected OAuth accounts, active sessions and the rest of
  the personal account surface, all delegated to the
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Components.UserSettings` LiveComponent (the same one
  parent apps can embed standalone).

  Served at `/profile/settings`, in both the locale-prefixed and prefixless
  shapes the `locale_scope` macro emits. Replaces `/dashboard/settings`,
  which still routes but redirects here.

  Why a page of its own rather than another dashboard tab: the user dashboard
  is optional — a host can compile it out with `user_dashboard_enabled` — so
  hanging the account UI off it meant the only way to change your own email
  could vanish. This page is unconditional and wears
  `LayoutWrapper.app_layout`, so it renders the same whether it is reached
  from the admin header or from the host's own front end.

  Hosts that would rather own this surface set the `user_settings_path`
  setting; every menu entry resolves through
  `PhoenixKit.Utils.Routes.user_settings_path/1` and follows it there.
