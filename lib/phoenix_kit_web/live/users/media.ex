defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Users.Media do
  @moduledoc """
  Media management LiveView — thin wrapper around `MediaBrowser` LiveComponent.

  This LiveView owns the page layout and assigns required by
  `LayoutWrapper.app_layout`. All media browser state and logic live in
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.MediaBrowser`.

  URL sync (shareable `…/admin/media?folder=<uuid>` deep links) is provided
  by the `MediaBrowser.Embed` macro's `url_sync` option — it injects the
  `handle_params` / `{:navigate}` → `push_patch` round-trip and parses
  `:initial_params` from the URL in `on_mount`, so this module only owns
  the page-chrome assigns.

  ## Libraries

  The page shows one library at a time, and **what it shows depends on who is
  looking** (`dev_docs/plans/2026-09-30-media-by-viewer.md`):

    * a **site library** (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Libraries`): the default one
      (Media) at the bare `/admin/media`, any other at `/admin/media/library/<slug>`.
      An Owner/Admin, or a holder of `media.view_all`, sees every file. A holder
      of `media` without it sees only their own stuff: the files they uploaded,
      the folders they created or that hold their files, and those folders'
      ancestors (`MediaBrowser`'s `viewer_uuid`).
    * one of the viewer's **own or shared user libraries** (while user libraries
      are on and the viewer holds `storage`), at `/admin/media/my/<slug or uuid>`,
      with the rights their role gives them there.

  They share one switcher, grouped "Site" and "Mine". While there is only one
  library, nothing about libraries is shown. Another user's library is opened, by
  an Owner/Admin, at `/admin/libraries` (audit-logged), not here. Libraries are
  created, renamed and deleted in Settings → Media → Libraries (site) and on the
  profile's Media tab (user).
