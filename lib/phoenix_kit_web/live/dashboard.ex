defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Dashboard do
  @moduledoc """
  The `/admin` landing page.

  It is built to be the page ANY authenticated visitor can safely be sent to,
  whatever their permissions. Two halves:

    * a **welcome block**, rendered for everyone, greeting the visitor by name;
    * the **operator overview** (`PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.DashboardOverview`),
      every block of which is permission-gated by
      `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Dashboard.Overview`.

  A visitor holding no permissions sees the welcome block and nothing else —
  no statistics, no System Information, no cards, and (because the overview
  decides before it queries) not one operator query or PubSub subscription on
  their behalf. That is what makes the page safe as a universal landing.

  Reaching it is not the same as being allowed to see all of it. The route sits
  in the ordinary admin `live_session`, alongside every other `/admin/*` page,
  so admin navigation to and from it stays a live patch rather than a full page
  reload. What admits a permission-less visitor is the GATE:
  `:phoenix_kit_ensure_admin` recognises this view via
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth.landing_view?/1` and skips the admin-area and
  per-view permission checks for it alone — authentication, the account gate
  and the locale hook still run. The overview's own gates are what keep the
  operator blocks away from whoever gets in.

  Because nobody is ever evicted from this page, it has to survive a permission
  change in place: `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth`'s scope-refresh hook skips its
  eviction for the landing view and instead calls
  `phoenix_kit_scope_changed/1`, which re-runs
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Dashboard.Overview.assign_scope_gates/1`. A demoted
  operator watches the cards and statistics disappear (and the subscriptions
  behind them close) without leaving the page or reloading it.

  `/dashboard` is a SEPARATE page (`PhoenixKitWeb.Live.Dashboard.Index`),
  deprecated since 2026-07-27 and sharing nothing with this one.

  # being silently swallowed. The embedded home view runs in its own process
  # and sends only this one message, so nothing else arrives here.

  # Greeting pools for the welcome block. One KEY is drawn per mount — the

  # overview (PubSub-driven re-renders) never re-roll it mid-visit. Keys
  # resolve to text through `greeting_text/1` at RENDER time, so gettext
  # still follows a locale switch (see `welcome_block/1`).
  #
  # `mount/3` itself runs TWICE per page load (disconnected HTTP render, then
  # the connected websocket mount) — picking randomly in both would re-roll
  # the greeting out from under the visitor the instant the socket connects.
  # Only the connected pass draws; the disconnected pass gets the plain
  # default, same as every other visitor-specific value this page defers
  # until it can subscribe (see `Overview.assign_overview/3`).

  The welcome half of `/admin` — the part with no permission gate at all, and
  therefore the whole page for a visitor holding nothing.

  Deliberately an `<h2>`, not an `<h1>`: the page's one header is the
  `LayoutWrapper` breadcrumb, and this sits at the same level as the operator
  overview's own section headings.

  The greeting is a key resolved through `greeting_text/1`, whose clauses are
  literal `gettext/1` calls — new phrases fall back to English until locales
  catch up, `"Welcome back"` stays translated everywhere. The name is appended
  in markup rather than interpolated into a `"…, %{name}"` msgid, which would
  ship untranslated everywhere. It is a function component rather than mount
  assigns so that `gettext` runs at RENDER time: a locale switch that only
  patches params (`handle_params`, after mount) still reaches it.

  Greeting and name render inside ONE child element: `card-title` is a flex
  container with a gap, and as sibling flex items the phrase and the `, name`
  span drew that gap between the phrase and the comma.
