defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.AnnotationBurnController do
  @moduledoc """
  Accepts a picture with its annotations already drawn into it, and stores
  that rendering as display variants.

  ## Why the client renders it

  The browser has the annotation layer on screen, drawn by the same engine
  that will draw it next time. Composing there means the stored picture IS
  what the user was looking at: the same fonts, the same label plates, the
  same smooth marker strokes, and no second renderer to keep in step with
  the first. `Etcher.Raster` remains the server-side path for backfill and
  for files nobody has open, where an approximation is the right trade.

  ## What this means for trust

  The bytes come from a client, so they are treated as a picture and nothing
  more: re-encoded through `ImageProcessor.sanitize/3` into the variant
  slot, never served back as uploaded. The caller must be signed in and
  allowed to edit the file, and the annotation set is not consulted — this
  endpoint replaces a rendering, it cannot change what the file's
  annotations ARE.

  ## What gets written

  The burn arrives at full resolution and is resized into whichever slots
  the caller names (`thumbnail` by default) in one request — making one is
  expensive enough that nobody should have to send it twice.

  Writable slots are `thumbnail` (list rows), `burned` (grid cards, fit
  inside an 800px box) and `burned_large` (the copy the media viewer opens
  with, fit inside 1920px). `small`, `medium`, `large` and `original` are not
  writable. The editor opens on `small` and climbs `medium` → `large` →
  `original`, drawing the live shapes on top; a burn stored in any of those
  would paint every annotation a second time. `original` stays the picture
  as uploaded for the same reason a rendering must stay removable.

  The client sends `source_version`, the `v` query of the original URL it
  composed over. When that names an original this file no longer has, the
  write is refused.

  `POST /api/files/:file_uuid/burn` — multipart, field `image`.

  Optional `variants` (`thumbnail`, `burned`, `burned_large`; default `thumbnail`),
  `source_version` (the original URL's `v`), and `fingerprint` — what the
  drawing was when this copy was made, handed back on the next open so a
  client with an unchanged drawing can skip the compose entirely.

  Answers with each variant that was written and a fresh signed URL for it,
  so a caller can show the result without guessing the URL or waiting for a
