defmodule PhoenixKitWeb.Users.MultiSession do
  @moduledoc """
  Multi-account session switching.

  The Plug session holds an ordered stack of raw session tokens under
  `:pk_session_accounts`. `hd/1` of the stack is the ROOT account (the original
  login). The currently active token stays in `:user_token`, so all existing auth
  resolution (`fetch_phoenix_kit_current_*`, `on_mount`) is untouched.

  Read helpers (`gate_allowed?/1`, `list_accounts/1`) take the string-keyed session
  map (works from both the plug and the LiveView on_mount). Conn-mutating ops
  (`add_account/3`, `add_authenticated_user/3`, `switch_to/2`, `remove_account/2`,
  logout helpers) take and return a `Plug.Conn`.

  ## Surviving a lost session

  The Plug session is the only place the stack lives, and on most hosts that is
  a *browser-session* cookie: `mix phx.new` ships `@session_options` with no
  `max_age`, so it is gone on browser restart. The remembered identity survives
  that — `PhoenixKitWeb.Users.Auth.ensure_user_token/1` rebuilds the session
  from the remember-me cookie — but that cookie holds exactly ONE token, so
  every account the user had added silently disappeared and the switcher came
  back holding a single row.

  So the added accounts are mirrored into a second persistent cookie
  (`persist_account/2`), and `restore_persisted_accounts/2` rebuilds the whole
  stack next to the remembered root. Three rules keep that mirror honest:

  - **It never outlives the remembered identity.** Nothing is written unless
    this browser already holds a remember-me cookie, so a deliberately
    session-only login stays session-only for every account in it, and
    `remember_me_enabled: false` blocks the mirror exactly as it blocks
    remember-me.
  - **It holds only what the user asked for.** An impersonation is support
    access, not an account of the operator's, so `impersonate/2` appends to the
    session stack and writes nothing here: "sign in as this user" ends with the
    browser session, as it did before any of this existed.
  - **It is bound to the identity that built it.** The cookie names the root
    token it belongs to, and `restore_persisted_accounts/2` refuses a mirror
    naming any other. A fresh login clears the cookie too, but that is hygiene,
    not the control: a browser is free to ignore a deletion, and the tokens in a
    stale mirror stay valid until they expire — so on a shared computer the next
    person to sign in would otherwise inherit the previous user's accounts.

  The restored account becomes the root; the account that happened to be active
  when the browser closed is not remembered. Coming back as the identity you
  logged in as is the predictable outcome — and the safe one, since the
  alternative is resuming inside a borrowed account.

  Adds `target` to the session stack on an administrator's authority, without
  their password — "log in as this user".

  Shares every invariant of `add_authenticated_user/2` and adds the authority
  checks that separate support access from account takeover:

  - the **root** account decides, never the active one. Otherwise an
    administrator could impersonate a user and, from inside that session,
    impersonate someone the user could never reach;
  - the root must hold the Owner or Admin **role**. Deliberately not
    `can_access_admin_area?/1`: that is true for *any* permission holder, so a
    customer granted one self-service permission would qualify — and could then
    borrow another customer's account;
  - an Owner is never a target. The one account that can undo anything must not
    be reachable by borrowing it;
  - an Admin root cannot take another Admin either — support access is for the
    people being supported, not sideways between staff. An Owner root may,
    because there is nothing above it to escalate to.

  A success is logged as `session.impersonated` — one row, written in place of
  the `session.account_added` the stack append would otherwise have written. A
  refusal is logged as `session.impersonation_refused` with the deciding rule in
  `metadata["reason"]`: an impersonation nobody can see afterwards is the thing
  that makes this feature dangerous, and a *rejected* attempt to borrow the
  owner's account is the entry whoever watches the feed most wants to find.

  Refusal rows carry no `target_uuid` on purpose. `Activity.log/1` fans a row
  with one out to that user's notification inbox, and a refused attempt is a
  signal for the feed, not a message to the person it named.

  Rebuilds the session stack around `root_token` from the persistent cookie.

  Called from the plug's remember-me recovery, the one moment a real session is
  reconstructed from cookies alone.

  The mirror is accepted only if it names `root_token` as the identity it was
  built under. Clearing the cookie at login is a request the browser is free to
  ignore, and the tokens in a stale mirror stay valid until they expire — so
  without this check the next person to sign in on a shared browser inherits the
  previous user's accounts, live, in their own switcher. Binding makes that
  unforgeable rather than merely unlikely: a login mints a new session token, so
  a mirror written before it can never name the new root.

  Tokens that no longer resolve to an active user are dropped *and* pruned from
  the cookie: this is the only pass that ever looks at them, so without it a
  revoked account would be re-offered for the cookie's full life.

  Restores nothing while `multi_session_enabled` is off, and takes the cookie
  with it — turning the feature off should not leave a browser quietly holding
  other people's sessions until someone turns it back on.
