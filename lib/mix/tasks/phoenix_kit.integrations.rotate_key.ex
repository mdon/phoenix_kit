defmodule Mix.Tasks.PhoenixKit.Integrations.RotateKey do
  @moduledoc """
  Rotates the encryption key protecting stored integration credentials.

  ## Usage

      $ mix phoenix_kit.integrations.rotate_key --dry-run
      $ mix phoenix_kit.integrations.rotate_key
      $ mix phoenix_kit.integrations.rotate_key --new-key="<already-generated-secret>"

  ## What it does

  1. If a key store is configured (`:integrations_key_store`), checks it can
     be written to — BEFORE touching any data. Rotation is the dangerous
     moment: once rows are re-encrypted, a store that then refuses the write
     leaves you holding a database no key opens.
  2. Reads every stored integration connection.
  3. Decrypts each one under whichever key is CURRENTLY active (a
     dedicated `:integrations_encryption_key` if configured, then a
     configured key store, else the legacy `secret_key_base`-derived key —
     see `PhoenixKit.Integrations.Encryption`).
  4. If every row decrypts cleanly, re-encrypts all of them under the new
     secret in a single database transaction — either every connection
     rotates, or (on any failure) none do.
  5. Stores the new secret and **reads it back to confirm it landed** before
     reporting success. A write that returns `:ok` and did not land is the
     failure this exists to prevent.

  ## With and without a key store

  With `:integrations_key_store` configured, the secret is written there and
  the app picks it up on restart — no config edit, and the secret is not
  printed because it does not need to be. See
  `PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore`; the default
  `PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyStore.File` writes one file, mode 0600, outside
  the repository, and is per-host.

  Without one, behaviour is unchanged: the secret is printed exactly once and
  saved nowhere, with a warning saying so. You must then configure
  `integrations_encryption_key` yourself and restart.

  Migrating from an explicit key to a store is one rotation: run this with both
  set (the explicit key is what decrypts the current rows), then remove
  `integrations_encryption_key` and restart. The task says so explicitly when it
  sees both, because an explicit key outranks the store and a restart before
  removing it would read nothing.

  ## When to run this

    * **First adoption** — no dedicated key is configured yet, so every
      connection is protected only by the legacy `secret_key_base`-derived
      key. Run this once, set the printed secret, restart.
    * **Suspected key compromise** — a dedicated key is already configured.
      Run this, replace the env var with the newly printed secret, restart.
      Treat the old key as permanently compromised; do not reuse it.

  ## Options

    * `--dry-run` — runs the decrypt-and-verify pass over every row and
      reports how many WOULD rotate, without generating a key or writing
      anything. Unlike a real rotation, this does NOT take row locks —
      it's a plain read, safe to run against live traffic at any time, not
      just before committing to a real rotation.
    * `--new-key` — supply your own secret instead of generating one (e.g.
      one already stored in a secrets manager). Skipped in `--dry-run`. Must
      not be empty — `--new-key=""` is refused outright rather than
      silently falling back to a generated secret, since that's very likely
      a shell variable that resolved empty (`--new-key="$MAYBE_UNSET"`) and
      not something you meant to ask for.

  ## Run this with nothing else writing to integration connections

  A real rotation's row lock only defends against ONE direction of a race
  with a concurrent writer (an OAuth token auto-refresh, a "Test
  Connection" click, ...) — see `PhoenixKit.Integrations.KeyRotation`'s
  moduledoc, "Atomicity and concurrent writers", for the exact mechanism
  and what it does NOT cover. In short: a writer that already read a row
  before rotation locked it can still silently overwrite the freshly
  rotated row with old-key content after rotation commits, and `rotate/2`
  will have already reported success by then. **Pause anything that could
  write to integration connections (most concretely: an OAuth token-refresh
  worker) before running this for real, and do not resume it until you have
  restarted the app under the new key** — not just until this command
  returns. Treat the whole span, start to restart, as one maintenance
  window.

  ## The gap between rotating and restarting

  Rotation only changes what's in the database; the running app keeps using
  the OLD key until you set the new one and restart. This is the SAME
  maintenance window the section above requires — it doesn't end when this
  command returns, it ends when the app is running under the new key. In
  that window:

    * A READ of a rotated connection does not raise or crash — a field
      that can't be decrypted under the still-active old key is logged
      and silently dropped from whatever asked for it (see
      `PhoenixKit.Integrations.Encryption`'s decrypt-failure handling),
      same as any other decrypt failure. Not an exception to catch — the
      field is simply absent.
    * A WRITE that must first read-and-merge the existing row (most writes
      in `PhoenixKit.Integrations` work this way, including fully
      automatic ones like a validation-status update after every
      token-refresh attempt) is NOT destructive just because it hits a
      row this task already rotated: it restores the untouched field's
      ciphertext before saving, as long as the write itself doesn't
      supply a fresh value for that exact field. The field stays exactly
      as rotation left it and decrypts fine again once the app restarts.
    * A WRITE that DOES supply a fresh value for that exact field is
      still at risk, whether it's this simple gap or the race the section
      above describes: whatever gets encrypted uses whichever key is
      ACTIVE, which is still the OLD one until the app restarts, so that
      value lands under the OLD key in a row this task already moved to
      the new secret. It then fails to decrypt once the app restarts onto
      the new key, indistinguishable from unrelated corruption.

  There is no dual-key fallback to paper over any of this (it would
  silently mask exactly the failure class this task exists to prevent).
  Restart promptly, and keep writers paused until you do.
