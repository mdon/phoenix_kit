  Final boot step — call from `Application.start/2` right after
  `Supervisor.start_link/2`.

  Picks up `:phoenix_kit_<x>` modules whose beams loaded after
  `PhoenixKit.ModuleRegistry` initialised (a `:phoenix_kit_*` dep starts
  *after* `:phoenix_kit` itself, so the registry's first scan can miss
  it), then runs every registered module's `migrate_legacy/0` callback.

  Returns the supervisor result unchanged so it composes:

      def start(_type, _args) do
        children = [...]
        opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
        Supervisor.start_link(children, opts) |> PhoenixKit.boot()
      end

  If `Supervisor.start_link/2` returned `{:error, _}`, this is a no-op —
  the error passes through unchanged.

  `mix phoenix_kit.install` and `mix phoenix_kit.update` wire this in
  automatically; existing apps can add the call manually.

  #   * It is read once, at boot. Changing the config needs a restart.

  # that tab and must NOT be listed here — double-registration hits the override
  # path. This is for matrix-only keys with no tab of their own.
  #
  # Bad entries RAISE, failing app start. Config is a deploy-time contract, and
  # logging-and-skipping would hide the mistake until a colleague hit a 403 —

  # ..." log line for every LiveView `handle_event` — including the
  # Settings/Authorization form's `validate_settings`/`save_settings`,
  # which carry OAuth/AWS credentials stored generically in
  # `phoenix_kit_settings` (key names like `oauth_google_client_secret`).
  # Found leaking those values in cleartext into a live install's log file
  # (S007/S009).

  # `filter_parameters` is a HOST-app `Application` env key: a dependency's
  # own `config/config.exs` is never merged into it, so PhoenixKit cannot
  # ship this as config the usual way — and asking every host to remember
  # to add the line is the same silent-blacklist failure mode `settings.ex`
  # already moved away from for the settings *display* side (see
  # `@public_setting_keys`). Setting it once here, at boot, protects every
  # host without any action on its part.
  #
  # `{:keep, [...]}` mode is left alone: in keep-mode anything NOT
  # explicitly kept is already filtered by default, so a key we don't know
  # about here is already safe.
  #
  # Every OTHER shape gets REPLACED, not merged into — deliberately, found
  # by a destructive test (a real LiveView save, run through the real
  # code path) after an earlier "merge with whatever's there" version
  # silently protected nobody:
  #
  # `Phoenix.start/2` (`:phoenix`'s own OTP app boot — always finishes
  # before the HOST's supervisor tree, and therefore before `boot/1` runs)
  # unconditionally pre-compiles `:phoenix, :filter_parameters` into an
  # opaque `{:compiled, key_match, value_match}` `:binary.compile_pattern/1`
  # term, on EVERY boot — not only when a host configured something: Phoenix
  # itself ships a package-level default env of `["password", "token"]`
  # (`deps/phoenix/mix.exs`, `application/0`), so `Application.get_env/2`
  # already returns non-nil before any host config is even read. That means
  # by the time `boot/1` runs, this is ALWAYS already `{:compiled, ...}` —
  # not a rare shape a sophisticated host opts into. There is no API to
  # recover a word list from it, so "leave a compiled filter alone" is, in
  # practice, "leave every host alone" — the opposite of this function's
  # purpose. A plain (uncompiled) list works exactly the same at the
  # `filter_values/1` call site (it just re-compiles the pattern on that
  # one call instead of reusing a cached one — negligible on a settings
  # save) — so overwrite with Phoenix's own documented default plus ours.
  # The one real cost: a host that customized this beyond Phoenix's default
  # loses that customization here.
